id="h.g9m6zb4ftflh"><span class="c2 c37">Prologue</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c25 c26">&ldquo;We all try to live a normal life, surrounding ourselves with the people we love and the things that bring us comfort. We chase after happiness&mdash;earning money, saving what we can, spending on what brings us or those we cherish a bit of joy. In one way or another, we work to become strong, telling ourselves it&rsquo;s to protect what matters most.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c15 c12"><span class="c25 c26"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c25 c26">&ldquo;But strength is a strange thing. For some, it&rsquo;s measured in wealth, for others, in knowledge or physical ability. Some excel at creative pursuits, others at sports or simple everyday skills. A few really do seem unbreakable in mind. And there are those whose strength lies in words&mdash;inspiring, persuading, drawing others in, sometimes just by being present.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c15 c12"><span class="c25 c26"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c29">&ldquo;</span><span class="c19">But what about moments when none of your strengths matter? What about the nightmare you cannot wake from&mdash;the one where your loved ones are suffering and you are utterly powerless? Even the bravest soul or the brightest mind can be brought to their knees by pain that refuses to let go. How long could you stare into loss, into horror, without flinching&mdash;without wishing to turn away, to close your eyes and erase what you&rsquo;ve seen? </span><span class="c25 c26">Sometimes, even just a blink gives a tiny, stolen moment of relief. But what if blinking is the only escape you have&mdash;a brief darkness before the torment floods back in as soon as you open your eyes again? Sometimes, the pain is so deep, you want nothing more than to shut your eyes forever.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c15 c12"><span class="c25 c26"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c29">There it is&mdash;</span><span class="c3 c29">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c29 c3">A high-pitched, insistent WAIL!</span><span class="c25 c29 c3">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c15 c12"><span class="c25 c26"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c25 c26">&ldquo;What is that sound? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be easier to never wake up, to stay in this darkness, away from memories that haunt and ache? Until we face such impossible moments, can any of us truly claim to know our own strength? What would you actually do if all comfort slipped away? How long would it take to gather whatever remains of your courage and force your eyes open, when every part of you wants to keep them closed?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c15 c12"><span class="c25 c26"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c25 c26">&ldquo;Whether you&rsquo;re alone or surrounded by hands that want to help, in the end, facing those unbearable sights and living on with your scars is a choice only you can make. No one would judge you for wanting instead to let go&mdash;letting the memories fade, keeping your eyes closed, forever.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c29">&ldquo;</span><span class="c19">Once, I thought I was strong. I believed I could carry any burden, bear any memory no matter how sharp its edges. I was wrong. Real strength isn&rsquo;t found in never faltering, but in opening your eyes&mdash;again and again&mdash;no matter what waits in the darkness behind them.</span><span class="c25 c26">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c15 c12"><span class="c25 c26"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c2 c29 c3 c30">Beep-beep-beep-beep&hellip;</span></p><p class="c15 c12"><span class="c25 c26"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c25 c26">It&rsquo;s that sound again. Annoying, relentless. But this time, I know what it is. The alarm. I don&rsquo;t remember who set it or why it insists on dragging me out of the darkness, calling me back to a world I&rsquo;d rather not see. But maybe&hellip; maybe it&rsquo;s my time. Time to open my eyes. Finally,</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7 c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c33" id="h.h9ms1a3ny13h"><span class="c2 c23">Chapter 1: Aryan</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c2">Present Day</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3">&quot;BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c19">It was 8 AM. Again. The digital clock on my nightstand blinked its relentless red numbers through a dim patch of sunlight leaking in around the curtains. I awoke with a start, the residue of that same weird dream&mdash;fragmented and unnerving&mdash;lingering in the quiet. My room still held the warmth of sleep, the comforting must of old books stacked by my bedside. The ceiling fan hummed softly above, stirring the air just enough to remind me I was really here, awake, on the edge of another ordinary day. </span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c25 c26">The room was quiet&mdash;almost too quiet&mdash;but I told myself that was normal. I glanced at the door and tried to picture the usual morning flurry, told myself that Ria and Kian must have already headed out, just as they always did, leaving me to wake up on my own. They never woke me. It was always like this.</span></p><p class="c15 c12"><span class="c25 c26"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c29">I held on to that thought, letting it fill the emptiness, smoothing over the things I didn&rsquo;t want to see or question. As I sat there, something familiar tugged at the edges of my awareness&mdash;a thread from my past, poised to unravel a memory of Ria. I followed it like I always did, because the past was easier to hold than whatever the morning might truly bring.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ria had known me since childhood, a perfect example of a true better half. I&#39;d fallen for her the moment I first saw her in Grade 6, on her very first day after transferring to our class. I didn&#39;t know it was love then&mdash;it was too hard to describe. We became good friends, but I never confessed my feelings, not even as years went by. My memories of her weren&#39;t like simple pictures in a photo album; they were a living, breathing tapestry. I could access them, zoom in on a specific moment, and feel the emotions as if they were happening all over again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My mind, the &#39;threads&#39; that made me who I was, kept a meticulous log of our shared history. I could pull up the exact moment she first smiled at me after I dropped a book, the precise words of a conversation we had in the school cafeteria when we were 15, the way her hair smelled when we sat side-by-side studying for an exam. These weren&rsquo;t just facts; they were sensory experiences, fully cataloged and ready for recall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After Grade 10, I moved to a different school. In college, I met someone new, fell in love for a second time, and even got bold enough to propose. But things fizzled out early on. Part of life, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, unexpectedly, I met Ria again during a final-year campus interview, held for all colleges under our university. She was thrilled to see me, and we ended up spending most of our time together, even after the interview wrapped up. We reminisced, reconciling over shared school-day memories. At the end of the day, the results were announced. I got the job (of course) and I&#39;m still with the same company today. Ria, unfortunately, didn&#39;t clear it. But to my surprise, she was genuinely happy for me. More importantly, she was happy she&#39;d gotten to spend time with me. I felt it then, a deep conviction that she loved me too. And somewhere inside, I sensed she wanted me to propose, right there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I did. She said &quot;Yes!&quot; And that&#39;s where our beautiful life began, eventually leading to Kian, our son, who just started kindergarten this year.</span></p><hr><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3">&quot;Ring! Ring!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re late for your meeting, the boss is tense, where are you? On the way?&quot; Dev&#39;s voice was immediate, a rapid-fire question after I answered the call.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oops, is it 10 AM already? Sorry, Dev, I got carried away with my thoughts. I haven&#39;t even left home yet. Ria and Kian headed out without waking me up.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dev was silent for a moment, then responded, &quot;It&#39;s fine. Just join the Zoom call at least. As your junior, I&#39;ll come up with a better reason than &#39;got carried away&#39; to inform the boss.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Thanks, Dev! I&#39;ll join right away.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dev was more than just a colleague; he was a friend from the office. I never really considered him my junior; he&#39;d always been a tremendous help, both personally and professionally. And I almost forgot to tell you about myself and my job! I&#39;m Aryan Jith, Director of Technology&mdash;or DOT, for short&mdash;at a leading firm here in Bengaluru, India. Our corporate policy prevents me from disclosing the firm&#39;s name publicly, but if you&#39;re in the corporate or IT world, you&#39;ll understand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I initially mentioned clearing that job interview, my &quot;of course&quot; might have sounded arrogant. But it wasn&#39;t. For most of my life, I&#39;ve sailed through exams with surprising ease. I have a knack, a unique ability, to absorb knowledge almost effortlessly.</span></p><hr><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T2:</span><span class="c7 c3">&nbsp;&quot;Wait! Not yet.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T1:</span><span class="c7 c3">&nbsp;&quot;....&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T2:</span><span class="c7 c3">&nbsp;&quot;We can continue the love story a bit more!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T1:</span><span class="c7 c3">&nbsp;&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyway, when Ria accepted my love, all I could think of was being with her always. The new job was paying me close to 40K per month, and I had to move to Bengaluru with a joining date just a month away. Since Ria hadn&#39;t cleared the interview, it was obvious we might have to be apart. Of course, she could easily clear another interview, but what was the guarantee she&#39;d find one in the same city as me?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You might think this was a dramatic leap for a guy who&#39;d just proposed, but for me, this feeling had started in Grade 6. After so much waiting, we were finally together, and I didn&#39;t want to be away from her anymore. I had to think quickly. If her parents found out about the interview result, our options would be limited. A decision had to be made right then. Even as I discussed this with Ria, a part of my mind was racing, searching for a solution. And what I found was... perfect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Ria, this will work out! Trust me!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What&#39;s gotten into you? We should take this slow,&quot; a surprised Ria said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s not like I asked us to get married right away or even live together! I just want us to be in the same city.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I know, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll get a job, and I&#39;ll only accept it if it&#39;s in Bengaluru. I might not be like you, I don&#39;t have any superpowers, but I can get myself a job in any city I want.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey! I never meant anything like that. You can always move there and get a job later. We&#39;ll find PG accommodation close to each other, please think about it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;But I can&#39;t take your money!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Look! I don&#39;t have anyone, you know that, Ria! I get 40K; half of that is enough for me. Let&#39;s go with this plan. I&#39;ll just make an offer letter for you, just like the one I got, and mention the salary as 20K. Your parents will be happy with that!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;But I won&#39;t be.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Please, Ria! I know it&#39;s too much, all of a sudden. But can you at least think about this?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I want to, but you&#39;re not giving me any time to think!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We can&#39;t say you didn&#39;t get a job now and then change it once you&#39;ve made up your mind. Let&#39;s go with this plan now, and maybe later, if you really can&#39;t go ahead with it, I&#39;ll send a letter from the office saying your joining date is postponed due to some unexpected situation.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;....&quot; Ria stared at me. What was going on in her mind?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What?&quot; I asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;How are you even doing this? When did you even think about such an elaborate plan? We just confessed our love to each other an hour ago!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I just looked at her. &quot;You know how!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ria sighed. &quot;Of course! Your superpower! Okay! I agree with your plan. I know you&#39;re not doing this just for you, and I do trust you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Thanks!&quot; I smiled.</span></p><hr><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T2:</span><span class="c7 c3">&nbsp;&quot;Stoppp!!!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T1:</span><span class="c7 c3">&nbsp;&quot;Again? What now?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T2:</span><span class="c7 c3">&nbsp;&quot;You are talking about it again! Not yet!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T1:</span><span class="c7 c3">&nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s not me! It&#39;s Ria this time!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T2:</span><span class="c7 c3">&nbsp;&quot;Stop it. Doesn&#39;t matter, they are getting this from you!&quot;</span></p><hr><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyway, our Zoom call just got over. It was the usual bug report call, with high-priority issues they wanted me to fix right away. Of course, I had to fix it, even as the DOT, since I created this entire framework. Wait a minute, did I tell you how a 28-year-old guy with just six years of experience became the Director of Technology? Well, I could have asked for a higher role, but I preferred this.</span></p><hr><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T3:</span><span class="c3 c7">&nbsp;&quot;You sound arrogant again!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T1:</span><span class="c7 c3">&nbsp;&quot;....&quot;</span></p><hr><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>No! It&#39;s not like that. The moment I joined this organization as a fresher, I immediately grasped their vision and their problem statement. I love programming and computers &ndash; I&#39;d even say I literally am one. So, by the end of my first year and my probation period, I started a side project at home. I created a new programming language named </span><span class="c2">JIT</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and a framework specifically designed to solve all the problems the firm&#39;s current system faced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the end of the second year, my side project was successfully completed, and I showcased it to all the stakeholders of our main project. They were incredibly impressed, but they weren&#39;t ready to give me any credit for it. They claimed it belonged entirely to the firm, arguing that anything I created while working for them was their property. I was a bit shocked by this statement. I never wanted credit or even money from it; I just loved the challenge, and I wanted recognition for my effort in solving it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I pursued legal action, submitting all the necessary proof that this entire side project was done at my home, outside my office hours. The worst part for them was my promise: if I won the legal battle, I would make JIT open source, meaning anyone &ndash; including their competitors &ndash; could access the code. They finally caved in. They offered me a new title they&#39;d just invented, </span><span class="c2">Director of Technology (DOT)</span><span class="c0">, a considerable salary hike, and confirmed job security with a percentage of the firm&#39;s stake.

How are you doing this?&quot; Dev once asked me at the office, his eyes wide.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Doing what? I was right there in the room during the discussion. I listened,&quot; I replied, feigning innocence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No kidding! You were almost ten meters away, and besides, you were arguing with the boss about something.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&quot;No, no! That wasn&#39;t an </span><span class="c3">argument</span><span class="c0">. He wanted a few more changes on the product and our framework. I just wasn&#39;t happy with it, because it might impact performance. Besides, a framework shouldn&#39;t be changed for every minor product enhancement. Those should be handled by the product team. You get me, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, I mean&mdash;I agree with the reason for your argument. But how were you able to keep up with the entire discussion we had here?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Again, it&#39;s not an argument, Dev! Don&#39;t use the word so loosely!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;....&quot; He looked visibly annoyed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What?&quot; I prompted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You should say!&quot; He was still waiting for the answer to his first question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Okay! But how many times do I have to tell you this? I can multi-task.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&quot;Well, that&#39;s an understatement! It&#39;s not like you just heard a few words from us in between your arguments... I mean, </span><span class="c3">conversation</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;with the boss. You knew everything we discussed. I was supposed to give you the KT, since you were away from the desk, but you casually walked in and summarized our entire meeting. Hah! Don&#39;t tell me you can...?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I can, what?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You can read our minds, right? So that&#39;s your superpower?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Bullshit! I&#39;m not some superhero who can read minds!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Then? You can see the future?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;....&quot; The silence felt awkward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Listen, Dev, I&#39;ve told you this before too! I don&#39;t have any such powers. I can hear and remember what I&#39;m able to hear. That&#39;s it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Even if it overlaps?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&quot;Well!

Power!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Bro, what are you? Some kind of Java program, using multi-threading in your brain? It&#39;s not that simple.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Remember, I was born long before Java came into existence, and I&#39;ve been this way for as long as I can remember.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&quot;So maybe </span><span class="c3">they</span><span>&nbsp;took inspiration from </span><span class="c3">me</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to create Java.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;As if they knew you and your special skill!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Just kidding!&quot; I grinned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I remembered one afternoon in the kitchen with Ria, a playful glint in her eyes. She&rsquo;d scooped a spoonful of mustard seeds, poured them onto a plate, and challenged me to count them. To her, it looked like I had just brushed my finger over the plate and given a random number: 172. But what she didn&rsquo;t see was the snapshot I&rsquo;d taken in my mind, making them aligned flat, not overlapping, a perfect image that I had sent to one of my threads. While I was still talking to her, the thread had processed the image and given me the final count. I simply let her believe it was a guess, and never explained her how.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You talk about it as if it&#39;s nothing, bro! So how do you explain you remembering literally everything? Like three hundred names and phone numbers of everyone in this building? You don&#39;t even save them on your phone!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I keep another thread, just to remember where every item is stored in my head, after listening to them, like an index.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;.... Unbelievable!&quot; Dev shook his head. &quot;And you call this normal?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;For me? Yes! Everyone has their own normal, bro! I&#39;ve been this way my entire life. If you ask a blind person, darkness is their normal, and they would have trained their entire life to overcome or get used to it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;But...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Dev! I&#39;m not comparing! I&#39;m just saying, what makes me normal are my other factors! I do bleed when you cut me, I do feel pain when someone dear to me gets hurt. I can&#39;t protect anyone from danger with my physical strength. I&#39;m a normal person in our reality.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Whatever, bro! You are awesome! More than any superpowers, I&#39;d say this skill of yours is what we all need in reality, for our day-to-day life!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;....&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I remembered the countless times this skill had made my life... well, easier. In school, while everyone else was scribbling furiously during a complex math problem, one of my threads would instantly calculate the answer. It was like how a normal person can instantly answer &quot;5+5&quot; but would have to pause and focus to solve &quot;1978 multiplied by 444.&quot; For me, there was no delay; the answer, </span><span class="c2">878,112</span><span class="c0">, would just appear in my head, provided by a background thread, leaving me free to listen to the teacher or even daydream. The same thing happened at the grocery store. I&#39;d add items to the basket&mdash;200 grams of carrots, 500 grams of onions, 750 grams of tomatoes&mdash;and with each fraction of a kilo, each fluctuating price and discount of 10%, 15%, or 25%, a thread would be calculating the final total. I&#39;d have the exact amount ready on my phone to pay with UPI before the shopkeeper&rsquo;s machine could even process it. He always seemed fascinated, as if I were performing some sort of magic trick. It was just my normal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What should we call this superpower of yours? Real-Time Reality?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s a funny name! But I&#39;ll take it!&quot; I grinned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dev smiled back, then I asked, &quot;Let&#39;s go for tea?&quot;</span></p><hr><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Real-Time Reality, huh?&quot; Ria mused that evening as we discussed our days. She seemed genuinely pleased with the name Dev had coined for my ability.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Why are you so interested in that now?&quot; I asked, a little surprised.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You know what? I think I&#39;ve been with you more than anyone else in this world, and ever since our school days, I&#39;ve seen you perform these extraordinary things, like a boy wonder! But you&#39;re not a boy anymore.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So, it&#39;s good to have a relevant name for this. You might not be interested, because it&#39;s your normal. But Real-Time Reality makes sense!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;How?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&quot;Because it&#39;s a power that every human wants or </span><span class="c3">can</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;have in reality. It&#39;s not a superpower like flying or super strength, or as you would say, it&#39;s not magic. In reality, it&#39;s a very much possible skill. Computers are a great example of that, and they say human brains are far more powerful than a CPU, and we&#39;re yet to unlock their full output.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re thinking so deep into it,&quot; I said, a smile touching my lips.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I might have often overshadowed Ria in our shared life, but she was always inherently smart, bringing her own kind of intelligence and knowledge to the table. Even with all my so-called super skills, I barely stood a chance against her academics. She was the rank holder, after all, in all our classes. Besides, it takes a personality like hers to find the courage to switch to a profession like Psychiatry even after completing engineering. She&#39;d only pursued engineering because her parents couldn&#39;t afford for her to study medicine. She also had her kid brother, Aswin, to consider.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But once we moved to Bengaluru after I got my job, she had all the time to study, plus a passive income of 20k per month to send to her parents. She meticulously crunched all the financial calculations and came up with a solid plan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Are you okay with this?&quot; I asked her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You mean the money? You did say you&#39;d give 20k per month. That&#39;s enough, I guess!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, not that! I&#39;m ready to commit 30k and any extra I make just to get a doctor in the family!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Then?&quot; she pressed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Us living together, so soon?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s the only solution I&#39;ve got! Two PGs, food expenses, etc. To cut those down, we should get a small house, a room and a kitchen. I&#39;ll cook our food, don&#39;t worry!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&quot;....&quot; Well, that&#39;s not what I had in mind! </span><span class="c3">Could</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">I even control myself? </span><span class="c0">I almost grinned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;ll sleep in the kitchen!&quot; she interrupted my thoughts abruptly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I sighed. &quot;It&#39;s okay, you can sleep in the room itself.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;With you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;ll find a house on the top floor. Most of these houses have an open terrace which is a common area, and unless it rains, I can sleep outside!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&quot;Are you sure?&quot; </span><span class="c3">Of course, only until you get comfortable</span><span class="c0">, I grinned again internally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Anything to make you a Doctor,&quot; I smiled, genuinely.</span></p><hr><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T2</span><span class="c3">: &quot;Sorry to interrupt your nostalgia, but I think we need to go pick up Kian. It&#39;s 3:30 PM.&quot;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T1</span><span class="c7 c3">: &quot;Oops! My bad. The school is just nearby, so we can be there in 5 minutes.&quot;</span></p><hr><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The playschool, a small, brightly painted building just a short drive from my house, was alive with the cheerful noise of the day&#39;s end. I could hear the faint echo of children&#39;s laughter from the playground as I walked toward the main gate, a familiar sense of calm washing over me. This was part of the routine&mdash;the good part. I waited in front of the school for a while. All the kids were coming out one by one. It was a playschool, so children were only brought outside if their parents were visible at the gate. It was a good system, so I made sure to stand right in front of them, where they could easily see me. I&#39;d missed seeing Kian in the morning, but now it felt like even more time had passed. When was the last time I actually saw him?</span></p><hr><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T4</span><span class="c3">: &quot;....&quot; (A blank, a pause)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T5</span><span class="c7 c3">: &quot;....&quot; (Another blank)</span></p><hr><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s strange! I&#39;m getting blanks from my threads. Anyway, I didn&#39;t see Kian anywhere, so I moved closer to the gate and told the Ayah (helper) that I was waiting for him. The woman, with her neatly tied bun and kind eyes, looked over my shoulder as if expecting someone else.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Just a minute, I&#39;ll check inside,&quot; she said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She looked nervous, maybe she had just started recently at this school. But no! I&#39;d seen her many times before. Then the headmistress came outside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Good Evening, Mufta Ma&#39;am! Can you get Kian? I&#39;ve been waiting for some time. How was he? Was he a good boy today? Hope he had his lunch on his own!&quot; I asked, trying to keep my tone light.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was hesitant to reply, as if she were thinking hard. I hoped Kian hadn&#39;t caused any trouble at school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Kian&#39;s mom already picked him up, Sir!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, okay!&quot; Ria picked him up already? But she hadn&#39;t informed me of anything. Had we had a fight or something last night that I couldn&#39;t recall?</span></p><hr><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T4</span><span class="c3">: &quot;....&quot; (More blanks)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T5</span><span class="c7 c3">: &quot;....&quot; (Still more blanks)</span></p><hr><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">More blanks? Why was the headmistress so hesitant to say Kian wasn&#39;t there? It was a strange feeling, like I had experienced all this before.</span></p><hr><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T4</span><span class="c3">: &quot;....&quot; (Yet more blanks)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T5</span><span class="c7 c3">: &quot;....&quot; (And again)</span></p><hr><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>As I moved away from the school, I noticed Mufta Ma&#39;am calling someone on her phone. </span><span class="c3">T2</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;could still hear her!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hello, Zoya Ma&#39;am! Aryan sir came again today! To pick Kian.

Riiing!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Most people cherished their ringtones&mdash;a favorite theme, a beloved song, a personal anthem. Some, indifferent to such things, simply stuck with the phone&rsquo;s default. But for me, </span><span class="c2">Zoya Kiran</span><span class="c0">, a Pro Bono Criminal Advocate, incoming calls were rarely a source of joy. They were either the distressed cries of a new victim entangled in their own personal tragedy, or the chilling threats from a convict&rsquo;s desperate kin, demanding I drop a case. My work made such calls a grim reality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3">&quot;Riiing! Riiing!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>This wasn&#39;t one of </span><span class="c3">those</span><span>&nbsp;calls. The screen displayed </span><span class="c2">&#39;Mufta (Kian&rsquo;s school)&#39;</span><span class="c0">. A familiar dread coiled in my stomach. I knew it. Aryan was there. Again. To pick up his son. Again. I answered, my voice steady despite the internal tremor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hello, Zoya Ma&#39;am! Aryan sir came again today! To pick Kian. I just informed him that you already picked him,&quot; Mufta&#39;s voice was a familiar blend of concern and practiced calm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you, Mufta. Sorry for the trouble. I hope you understand his situation, right?&rdquo; My words were automatic, a rehearsed script for the kind-hearted staff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Sure Ma&#39;am, we can understand!&quot; Mufta replied, her tone sympathetic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to call me, if anything happens.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Mufta disconnected the call. I lowered the phone, a sigh escaping my lips. </span><span class="c7 c3">What am I going to do with this guy?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c2">6 months ago &hellip; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had first met Aryan Jith close to six months ago. While my heart belonged to pro bono criminal advocacy&mdash;fighting for those wronged by the system, often the poor and marginalized&mdash;it alone didn&#39;t pay the bills. I worked for a corporate law firm, initially relegated to paperwork. But as news of my pro bono successes spread, the partners began to trust me with civil suits too. That&rsquo;s how I found myself at Aryan&rsquo;s corporate office.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In criminal law, my motto was simple: I never represented clients I believed were guilty. In civil cases, lines were blurrier; sometimes both parties were at fault, times both wronged. But in Aryan&rsquo;s case, the lines seemed clear. His company (whose name, due to client-attorney privilege, must remain undisclosed) was suing one of their star employees and a significant stakeholder: Aryan Jith. The contract was unambiguous: he was obligated to provide immediate support for his revolutionary coding language and framework, JIT. Yet, he had been Absent Without Leave (AWOL) for over a week, unresponsive to calls or emails.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was around my age, if not younger, yet held a Director position and stakes in a leading tech firm, earning what I could only dream of. He certainly couldn&#39;t be this irresponsible. I was happy to take the case. All I had to do was track him down and serve him the lawsuit, which demanded the immediate transfer of JIT&#39;s ownership to the company.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I found his address and arrived at a beautiful, independent villa. The house, named </span><span class="c2">Jith Nivas</span><span>, was a sprawling, modern structure with clean lines and large windows, surrounded by a lush garden. Instead of being &quot;meticulously manicured,&quot; it was a vibrant, sprawling space filled with a variety of trees and plants. A towering coconut tree stood sentinel near the entrance, its fronds rustling in the breeze. Further inside, I could make out the dark green foliage of a mango tree, a jackfruit tree, and a guava tree, their presence giving the home a sense of earthy comfort. The scent of jasmine from the overgrown bushes near the wrought-iron gate was a stark contrast to the boiling frustration I felt. The entire property exuded an air of effortless wealth and tranquility. </span><span class="c3">He must be loaded,</span><span>&nbsp;I thought, surprised by the grand scale of his home. </span><span class="c3">Is he even married? Why can&#39;t he just do his job properly?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The thought that he might just be enjoying an unplanned vacation, oblivious to the trouble he was causing, made my blood pressure spike.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The gate wasn&#39;t locked, a detail that struck me as either trusting or careless. I pushed it open, the gravel crunching loudly under my heels as I walked up the short driveway. The house was silent, but a soft, warm light glowed from a window on the ground floor. I rang the doorbell, a small, polite chime that felt out of place given the anger churning inside me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Inside, I heard an alarm sound, insistent and jarring. </span><span class="c3">It&#39;s 2 PM,</span><span>&nbsp;I noted, glancing at my watch. </span><span class="c3">Who keeps an alarm for 2 PM?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A moment later, the door creaked open.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>He was a man of average height, maybe a little on the taller side, with a </span><span class="c2">wheatish skin tone</span><span>. His hair was a rumpled mess, giving him a decidedly &quot;just-woken-up&quot; appearance. There was an </span><span class="c2">unfathomable depth in his gaze</span><span class="c0">, an unsettling quality that belied any signs of leisurely enjoyment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes! Please come in. I just woke up! Unfortunately, my wife and kid left in the morning without waking me; I might have overslept!&rdquo; he replied, inviting me inside with a disarmingly polite gesture.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stepped through the threshold, and the vast, open-plan living room unfolded before me. Sunlight poured in through the large windows, illuminating a space that was clearly designed for comfort and elegance. The furniture was modern and expensive&mdash;a plush, cream-colored sofa, a sleek wooden coffee table, and an impressive entertainment system. Yet, a quiet disorder was present. A single coffee mug, half-empty and with a faint ring of residue, sat on the mantelpiece, and a magazine lay open on the floor beside the couch, as if someone had just walked away from it. A light film of dust, barely noticeable unless you were looking for it, coated the sleek surfaces. The air, despite the open windows, felt a little still.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The mess was subtle but undeniable, a physical manifestation of a life suddenly put on hold. My corporate lawyer&#39;s mind, always looking for clues, immediately picked up on the signs of neglect. The details didn&#39;t quite match his words. A pang of pity mixed with professional curiosity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay! I&rsquo;m Zoya, a Corporate lawyer. Can we sit somewhere to discuss?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Sure, </span><span class="c2">Zoya Kiran</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;right? Let&rsquo;s sit over there!&rdquo; he said, gesturing toward the sofa. He seemed completely oblivious to the chaos around him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>I paused, surprised. </span><span class="c3">How did he know my full name? Did someone tip him off about the lawsuit? </span><span>I carefully sat on the edge of the large sofa, hoping the dust wouldn&#39;t transfer to my clothes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Have we met before? You seem to know my full name,&rdquo; I probed, trying to mask my suspicion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry about it! As a stakeholder, I&rsquo;ve been given details about the legal firm that represents us. When I got promoted.&rdquo; He offered a casual, almost innocent smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Our details?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, like all the current employees &ndash; name, designation, and phone number. It&rsquo;s in a printout along with the contract. Usually, no one looks into it. I just had time to pass, that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, okay. When was this?&rdquo; I frowned, trying to recall such a document.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Around three or four years back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;And you remembered my full name from that? Good memory!&rdquo; I said, a little impressed despite myself. </span><span class="c3">Zoya</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is a very common name, so he might have only remembered that much. It wasn&#39;t like he&#39;d remembered my phone number or anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Anyway, let me get to the reason why I&rsquo;m here. Your firm has decided to sue you! Based on your recent behavior of not showing up in the office and not supporting the framework you developed, which is a direct breach of the contract you signed!&rdquo; I cut straight to the chase, pulling out the official documents.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>He looked confused, or perhaps, </span><span class="c3">blank</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for a moment. Then he asked, &ldquo;Exactly how many days have I been away?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>My internal alarm bells started to ring. </span><span class="c7 c3">He doesn&rsquo;t remember? This is the same guy who just recalled my full name from a four-year-old printout.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been more than a week! And you are not responding to their phone calls or emails. That&rsquo;s their main concern!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh! Okay. Is it okay if I come to the office tomorrow?&rdquo; he asked hesitantly, the confusion still lingering.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That would be great! But they would still ask for a strong reason for being AWOL.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; He went blank again after that, like </span><span class="c3">he was genuinely trying to think of a strong reason</span><span class="c0">. His expression was too earnest for deception.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t make up a fake reason, Mr. Jith. See, this is a chance for the organization to get rid of you for the breach of contract. It clearly states you can&rsquo;t be AWOL for more than a week, and they filed the lawsuit immediately the next day. You can see where this is going, right?&rdquo; I pressed, trying to convey the gravity of his situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, but his eyes were still distant, consumed by some internal process.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not even supposed to say these things to you! My job was just to serve you the lawsuit!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, he jerked, as if an invisible jolt had passed through him, and he stood up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 3:30 PM. I need to pick my son from school,&rdquo; he said, all of a sudden. He didn&#39;t even look at his watch. I confirmed the time by glancing at my own&mdash;he was spot on. </span><span class="c7 c3">How did he know the time?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can it wait? We need to finish this discussion. I&rsquo;m even getting late for my next meeting!&rdquo; I said, my patience beginning to fray.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry! There&rsquo;s no one else to pick him up. Kian is just four years old, and my wife is doing her final year Diploma in Psychiatric Medicine, so she might not reach home till 5 PM. The school is very nearby, just five minutes away!&rdquo; he pleaded, a genuine desperation in his eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay! I will wait outside your home, if you don&rsquo;t mind!&rdquo; I didn&#39;t want to be inside his house when he wasn&#39;t there; it felt like a breach of privacy, especially given the circumstances.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine! You can stay inside! Please, I can&rsquo;t make you wait outside when you were so gracious enough to let me go in between our discussion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Wow, chivalry is still alive,</span><span>&nbsp;I thought, a flicker of surprise amidst my frustration. </span><span class="c3">And this guy is a gentleman.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;How could I stop a dad from picking up his son? I wasn&#39;t an animal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in ten minutes,&rdquo; he said hurriedly before rushing out the door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I waited there for more than thirty minutes, and he didn&#39;t turn up. The sunlight, once warm and inviting, now seemed to harshly illuminate the home&#39;s neglect. My eyes, which had initially skimmed over the subtle mess, now saw it in full detail. The half-empty coffee mug on the mantelpiece, which I had just assumed was a morning oversight, was now surrounded by a fine layer of dust, suggesting it had been sitting there for days, not hours. The coffee table was smudged with what looked like old fingerprints, and the sleek wooden surface was now visibly grimy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I tried calling his phone, the number the organization had given me, but it was switched off. The silence of the house was oppressive, broken only by the hum of the refrigerator in the distance. The quiet disorder was everywhere&mdash;a pile of folded laundry on a chair, a child&#39;s toy car left on the floor, and a single, faded photograph of a smiling family on a console table, its frame also coated in dust.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just what was this guy up to? Who would leave a stranger inside their house and be gone for so long? My patience was wearing thin. The disarray wasn&#39;t just a sign of a bachelor&#39;s mess; it was a deeper, sadder kind of clutter, a life frozen in time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, my phone rang. An unknown number.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hello, Zoya Ma&rsquo;am, Aryan here! There&rsquo;s some issue at my son&rsquo;s school, I&rsquo;m getting delayed here! Can we meet sometime tomorrow? I will come to the office.&rdquo; His voice was tinged with concern, a stark contrast to his earlier confusion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait, Aryan! Sir! But we need to finish this discussion; we will file this suit by EOD! But&hellip;&rdquo; I paused, a thought striking me. &ldquo;How did you get my phone number, first of all?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, I told you before! I saw your name and phone number together! My son is missing, ma&rsquo;am, they are saying he never came to school!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>My blood ran cold. </span><span class="c3">What? Your son is missing?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&quot;What are you planning to do? Give me the school details, I will come there!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Is this even true?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I thought, a fresh wave of suspicion mingling with a sudden, sharp concern.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to trouble you, Ma&rsquo;am, but I can understand; my situation looks too doubtful for you. I will ping you the location.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mr. Aryan, this is not the time for me or you to think about this. I am just coming there out of concern.&rdquo; I disconnected the call. Once I received the school&#39;s location, I closed Aryan&rsquo;s house from the outside and started towards the school on my scooter. It was hardly a few minutes&rsquo; ride, just like he had said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>As I rode, a chilling question echoed in my mind. </span><span class="c3">How could he remember my phone number from four years back? He either has a superhuman memory, or someone really tipped him off about this lawsuit. But why? He could have just turned up in the office before the week was over.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This day was getting stranger with every passing minute, pulling me deeper into a mystery far beyond corporate law.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c1 c20 c32" id="h.bae718kmo6xx"><span class="c10 c2"></span></h1><h1 class="c1 c20" id="h.8djx735a1qr5"><span class="c23 c2">Chapter 4: Zoya&#39;s Burden</span></h1><p class="c14"><span class="c17 c2">Same day continues &hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sometimes in life, it&#39;s too hard to judge a person. You can find yourself cautious around people who are nothing but genuine, just because of a shaky first impression. At other times, you blindly trust someone, only to be cheated. A person in a neat suit might spin a fake sob story to steal money, while someone in rags, truly begging for help at a traffic signal, might be dismissed. It&#39;s difficult to read people; you can never be sure if what you&#39;re seeing is a practiced act or a genuine cry for help. Aryan was a case study in this, a puzzle I was determined to solve.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I reached Kian&rsquo;s school within five minutes. A fully panicked Aryan stood in front of the gate, while the school staff stared at him from inside. Their tension was palpable; few kids were still being picked up by their parents, and a scene like this could tarnish the school&rsquo;s image. Aryan wasn&#39;t making a ruckus. He was just asking the headmistress, a calm but firm, mid-aged lady, the same question again and again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you sure Kian didn&#39;t come to school today, Mufta Ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; Aryan asked, his voice strained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, sir! How many times do I have to say this? We are 100% sure!&rdquo; she replied with a sigh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I walked over to Aryan, gently moving him away from the gate. &ldquo;Mr. Jith, what&rsquo;s happening here? You just told me your wife and son left home this morning, without waking you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, Zoya Ma&rsquo;am, Ria would have informed me if Kian wasn&#39;t going to school today!&rdquo; he insisted, his voice sharp with a desperation I knew was genuine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you call your wife to check?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, but her phone is switched off. She might be in a class,&rdquo; he said, the reasoning sounding rehearsed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay, let me talk to the school staff. Please don&#39;t interrupt me.&rdquo; My tone was firm. As a lawyer, I&#39;d seen plenty of similar scenes&mdash;schools trying to hide their negligence. I wondered if this was one of them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hi, I&#39;m Zoya, I work with Aryan,&rdquo; I said, intentionally omitting my profession to avoid alarming anyone. &ldquo;Can I speak in private with someone in charge?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The headmistress, Mufta, stepped forward. &ldquo;Yes, Ma&#39;am, I am the headmistress.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;May I know what&#39;s happening? Aryan called me in a panic, saying his son wasn&rsquo;t at school.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, Kian never came to school today. We really think something is wrong with Aryan, sir,&rdquo; Mufta said, her voice laced with genuine concern.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; I asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is the second time this week he&#39;s come to pick up Kian, even though he never came to school.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The second time? When was the last time?&rdquo; I asked, a shockwave of realization hitting me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Three days ago. But let me be clear, Kian hasn&#39;t come to school this entire week,&rdquo; she said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What the hell? A dizzying wave of confusion washed over me. What is going on? Aryan had told me Ria and Kian left home this morning, but Kian hadn&#39;t been in school all week. Was Ria doing something behind his back? But why take their son with her? A terrifying thought suddenly surfaced. A week?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who usually drops Kian off? Ria?&rdquo; I asked. Mufta nodded. &ldquo;So when was the last time you saw Ria?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s been over a week, Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she confirmed, her eyes widening in a shared realization.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A week. It couldn&#39;t be a coincidence. Aryan had been AWOL for a week, and for the same amount of time, no one had seen his wife or son. I didn&rsquo;t need to be a criminal lawyer to see that something was terribly wrong. I glanced at Aryan. He was a little way off, but he could hear us. He was shaking his head, arguing with himself, a terrifying spectacle of a man having a mental breakdown. Then he started running.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mr. Jith! Stop!&rdquo; I yelled, not wanting to cause a scene. My job was just to serve a corporate lawsuit this morning, where have I ended up now? Aryan ran across the road to a nearby tree and stopped. He wasn&#39;t fleeing; he was just trying to get away from the staring eyes. Then he started hitting his head against the tree. I rushed to stop him, but he was completely out of control. This was an emotional breakdown&mdash;a terrifying display of guilt. Did he hurt his family? The thought was unbearable. I was in his house... should I have searched it? Could I have found Ria or Kian, tied up... or worse?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, Aryan froze, his eyes staring into the void. I had to act now. I took out my phone and dialed the number for Inspector Manoj Kumar at the Electronic City Police Station.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hello, Electronic City Police station, this is Inspector Manoj Kumar.&rdquo; His voice was automatic, practiced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hi, Manoj sir, this is Lawyer Zoya Kiran.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Zoya Ma&rsquo;am, what can I do for you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Manoj sir, I&rsquo;m in front of a school where an IT professional is claiming his son is missing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He cut me off. &ldquo;Is this a child kidnapping situation? We have a special team&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, wait, please listen to me,&rdquo; I interrupted. &ldquo;The school staff hasn&#39;t seen the kid or his mother for over a week. But the father is adamant they left for school this morning.&rdquo; I paused, waiting for the implication to sink in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay. So the father could have done something. We need to search his house,&rdquo; Manoj concluded immediately.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Exactly what I was thinking. And the worst part is, he hasn&#39;t been to his office all week either,&rdquo; I added, my voice tight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This could be a homicide,&rdquo; Manoj said gravely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir, I will stall him here. Could you send someone to his house immediately? It&#39;s not locked. I just closed it from the outside without a key.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s great! I&#39;ll go there personally. We don&rsquo;t need a search warrant; we can say the house was found open when we arrived,&rdquo; he replied, a familiar, pragmatic tone in his voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Perfect, sir. I&#39;ll also share his Aadhaar ID. Please check if any case has been registered on him already.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sure. Ping me his ID, house address, and your current location. I&#39;m on patrol nearby; I can get there fast.&rdquo; The call ended.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I quickly messaged him the details from the lawsuit documents. Aryan remained frozen, his eyes vacant. We waited for thirty minutes. It was 5:30 PM when a police car pulled up. Inspector Manoj Kumar got out with two constables. They approached Aryan, and I went to speak with Manoj privately.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you find anything?&rdquo; I asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No. Nothing. No ropes, no signs of struggle, nothing,&rdquo; he responded, his expression grim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; My hopes plummeted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The crime could have happened somewhere else. We&rsquo;ll need to interrogate him,&rdquo; Manoj said, his suspicion now solidified.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hope we aren&#39;t jumping the gun,&rdquo; I said, a flicker of doubt returning. What if Ria and Kian had just left him?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Get me the mom&rsquo;s phone number from the school staff,&rdquo; Manoj instructed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I got Ria&#39;s number from Mufta and gave it to Manoj, who had his cybercrime unit check its status. Five minutes later, we got a response.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This number has been switched off for more than a week.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; My last glimmer of hope extinguished. Something was definitely wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&#39;re taking him in. It&#39;s late already. You can come to the station tomorrow,&rdquo; Manoj said, turning to his constables.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait, Manoj sir, he&#39;s not well. Shouldn&#39;t we take him to a doctor first?&rdquo; I asked, my concern for him overriding my role as a potential witness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No need, ma&#39;am. Most of these guys react this way when they&#39;re caught. Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll keep you posted.&rdquo; He brusquely put Aryan in the police vehicle and drove away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I got on my scooter, the events of the day replaying in my mind. The abandoned bike under the tree was likely Aryan&#39;s. It was a long journey home through Bengaluru traffic. Once I was home, I would call Manoj for an update on Aryan&#39;s condition.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One hour later, I was home. My phone rang. It was Manoj.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hello, Zoya Ma&rsquo;am, reached home?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, Manoj sir. Any updates on Aryan&#39;s situation? Did he say anything?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We did what we could to make him speak. We were patient at first, since he&rsquo;s a high-profile guy, but he just stared at us, not saying a word, even after so many attempts.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you hurt him?&rdquo; I asked, a wave of cold dread washing over me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not enough to be concerned. The bugger didn&rsquo;t open his mouth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It could be a medical situation, Manoj sir!&rdquo; My concern was now acute.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not really, Ma&#39;am. We&#39;ve seen so many cases like this. But there is something I wanted to discuss with you,&rdquo; he said, steering the conversation away from my fears.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The Aadhaar ID you shared? There was a case registered right here in our station.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? Who was the complainant?&rdquo; I asked, a jolt of surprise hitting me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the weird part. Aryan himself was the complainant. Just three days ago, he filed a report that his wife, Ria, and son, Kian, were missing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Three days ago? Meaning after leaving the school the previous time Mufta told him Kian didn&#39;t come to school?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What happened to that case?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, two officers from our station went to his house the next day. When he opened the door, he was very normal, looked like he&#39;d just woken up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A pattern emerged, chilling me to the core. &ldquo;Just woke up? What time was it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Around 12 PM. He told them his wife and son left that morning without waking him up,&rdquo; Manoj said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was too shocked to reply, the words catching in my throat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The officers figured it was a mistake filed by a drunk rich guy. They just stood there scratching their heads.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aryan gave them 500 rupees each, and they came back and closed the case,&rdquo; Manoj said bluntly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;They closed a missing persons case because of a bribe?&rdquo; I asked, though I wasn&#39;t surprised.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Come on, Zoya Ma&rsquo;am, it wasn&#39;t a bribe, more like a donation. These kinds of mistakes happen more often than you think.&rdquo; Manoj tried to justify his colleagues&#39; actions, but I wasn&#39;t buying it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fine, sir. But what does this mean? Why is Aryan doing this? Where are Ria and Kian? Does he even know what happened to them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ll only know if he opens his mouth. I&#39;ve told my guys to go easy on him for tonight. You can come tomorrow and we can talk to him together.&rdquo; With that, Manoj disconnected the call.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My mind was in complete turmoil. I felt the weight of my actions&mdash;had I just interfered and made things worse for an innocent man? But was it any better to begin with? What could I do now to fix this? I looked at my watch. It was 7:30 PM. It wasn&rsquo;t that late. I knew I wouldn&#39;t be able to sleep knowing Aryan, a man who was clearly mentally unstable, was being physically hurt by the police. I quickly informed my parents, got on my scooter, and headed for the Electronic City police station.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c1 c32 c20" id="h.om3t7iaad123"><span class="c2 c10"></span></h1><h1 class="c1 c20" id="h.tn0emwrx832g"><span class="c23 c2">Chapter 5: Where it all began</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c2">6 months + 14 Days ago &hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was 8 AM. Again. The alarm was a jolt, but my bed was empty. The room was quiet. I blinked, a little disoriented, and wondered if Ria and Kian were back from her parents&#39; place. They should have been home by now. Maybe they&#39;d left for school without waking me up, making a habit of it. I smiled to myself, picturing their morning rush.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But soon another thread in my mind caught my attention. A scent, soft and familiar, drifted in from the kitchen. I smelled something&mdash;Sambhar, maybe? I must have been so deep in sleep that I didn&#39;t hear Ria making breakfast for me before leaving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But then I heard it. A sound so normal, so right, it made my heart leap.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Kian, hurry up! You are going to be late for school!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I jumped out of bed and rushed out of the bedroom, desperate to catch a glimpse of them before they left. I made it to the hallway just in time to see Ria tying Kian&#39;s shoelaces by the door. She looked up and smiled at me. Kian waved excitedly. In that fleeting second, everything felt perfectly, wonderfully normal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled back, knelt to tie Kian&#39;s other shoelace, and kissed them both.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;When did you guys get back? Why didn&#39;t you call? I could have come to pick you up,&rdquo; I asked, my voice still thick with sleep.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ria smirked playfully. &ldquo;If you really wanted to, you could have easily asked one of your threads to wake you up! I told you the bus arrives at Electronic City by 6 a.m.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her playful jab hit its mark. My mental log told me she was right; the information was stored. I hadn&#39;t acted on it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I really thought you would call me. Next time, I will be at the bus stop at 6 a.m.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So you&#39;re not coming with us next time, either?&rdquo; she challenged. &ldquo;You know my parents are okay now, right? In fact, Mom sent you so many homemade sweets. They asked me to bring you with me next time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wow, where are they?&rdquo; I asked, a well-worn thread for changing the subject immediately activating.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ria just laughed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re on the kitchen counter, and don&#39;t think I didn&#39;t notice you changed the subject!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled, finally conceding. &ldquo;Okay, I&#39;ll come with you next time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Cool, we have a trip planned to Yercaud two weeks from now. Can we all go together?&rdquo; she asked, her voice full of hope.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&#39;s discuss it this evening. You two are getting late for your classes,&rdquo; I said, pointing at the clock on the wall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay, Kian, let&#39;s go! And Aryan,&rdquo; she called over her shoulder, &ldquo;the discussion is not over yet! See you in the evening! Eat your breakfast before you leave! Bye!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She rushed off with Kian in tow, their scooter a blur of happy colors disappearing down the street. I stood in the doorway, a thread of a smile still on my face as they vanished. She was right. I could have easily asked a thread to wake me up, but I hadn&#39;t. It was one of those small, lazy comforts of a routine so steady you take it for granted. I&#39;d missed them, of course, but I knew I&#39;d see them again in a few hours.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The house was quiet again, but the lingering scent of breakfast and the sight of the sweets on the kitchen counter felt like a promise of their return. I knew exactly what she was doing. She was making me miss them. And it was working. The living room was bathed in the warm, inviting light of the morning sun, illuminating a space that was the very picture of life. The coffee table, free of smudges or grime, held a small, perfectly centered vase of white lilies, their petals unfurled and pristine. The polished wooden floor gleamed, catching every ray of light, and not a single dust particle danced in the air. The throw blankets were folded with military precision over the arm of the couch, and a stack of magazines was neatly aligned, ready to be read. A framed photograph on the console table, a picture of our family smiling on a beach, was perfectly clean, its colors vibrant and full of life. It was a silent promise that even in their absence, her influence remained, making the space feel both empty and full at the same time. My mind, however, was no longer on breakfast, It was on the trip which Ria was planning with her family.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The moment Ria had mentioned Yercaud, an old, dormant thread had activated, bringing with it a flood of memories I usually kept locked away. It was a thread I called &quot;The Salem Incident.&quot; I had to find a way to avoid Salem, to make this trip about a new beginning, not a revisit to the place where everything had gone wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I walked to the kitchen counter and picked up one of the sweets her mother had made, a silent peace offering that felt as heavy as a stone in my hand. Her mother. I remembered her. I remembered the day she looked at me not as the boy who loved her daughter, but as a deceitful stranger who had manipulated her child&#39;s future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Years ago, after Ria didn&#39;t get the job at my firm, I couldn&#39;t stand the thought of us being apart. I had come up with a desperate, half-baked plan. I forged a fake offer letter from my company, complete with a 20K salary, knowing it would be enough to appease her parents and give her the freedom to pursue her real passion: medicine. The plan was flawless, or so I thought. Ria would move to Bengaluru with me, enroll to become a doctor, and her parents would be happy she was employed. For years, the thread held. She sent them a portion of her &quot;salary&quot; every month, and they believed she was a successful software engineer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The truth came crashing down on a surprise visit. One of her neighbors had mentioned she was always at a medical college library, not a corporate office. Her father, a man of quiet dignity and immense pride, confronted her. He felt we had not only lied, but had publicly shamed his family. He saw me as a parasite, a boy who took his daughter from his house with a lie and an empty promise. He didn&#39;t see the love, only the deceit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can still recall the look on Ria&#39;s face as he threw her things out of the house. I had no words to defend myself, no power to stop him. So we left. We got a registered marriage a week later, a quiet act of rebellion and commitment. We didn&rsquo;t need his blessing, but it broke Ria&#39;s heart to be estranged from her family.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The years since had healed some of those wounds. The birth of Kian was the olive branch that brought them back together, but their relationship with me remained strained, an unspoken acknowledgment of the past. I was never welcome in their home again, not officially. The last few times Ria went, I stayed behind, pretending work held me back. But Yercaud was different. It was a neutral ground, a chance for a new memory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The problem, however, was still Salem. Ria and Kian would leave on Saturday and spend two days at her parents&#39; home before the trip started. For me, that would be a return to the scene of my greatest failure. My threads ran a hundred simulations of that awkward reunion, the cold stares, the silent judgment. It was a risk I couldn&#39;t take. I had to find a way to skip those two days. The opportunity for a peaceful reunion was there, but it required me to once again, bend reality a little in my favor.</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyway I reached my office at my usual time. My primary task was debugging a critical API, a main thread running at 90% capacity. Four other threads ran in the background: one organizing my inbox, another indexing the morning&#39;s news, a third monitoring the stock market, and the fifth dedicated to the simmering problem of Yercaud. This was the steady-state of my mind. The firm&#39;s quiet hum was a backdrop, a stable operating system for my thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My friend and colleague, Dev, stormed in, a storm cloud on his face. He held a client presentation tablet and was talking into a headset, his voice a frantic low murmur.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aryan, we have a total system failure. The server for the client&rsquo;s presentation just went down, and a new intern just wiped a dozen crucial files for the launch. I need to get on this call, but I can&rsquo;t go in empty-handed. We&rsquo;re dead in the water.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Dev spoke, he held out the tablet, showing me an error message. For a single, imperceptible moment, I took a mental photograph of the screen&mdash;a new thread, a Diagnostic Thread, was now open. It took the image, ran a thousand scenarios against a mental database of system logs and error codes, and found a match in less than a second.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the same time, a new intern, Suraj, stepped nervously up to my desk, holding a single sheet of paper. &ldquo;Mr. Aryan, I&rsquo;m so sorry, but I was asked to translate this section of code documentation from Japanese, and I can&rsquo;t make sense of it. I don&rsquo;t know Japanese.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My fingers continued to dance across my own keyboard. I listened to Dev, hearing every word, and with my other hand, I took the sheet of paper from Suraj. My eyes, again for just a fraction of a second, snapped a picture of the document.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Japanese documentation,&quot; I thought to myself, a new, custom Language Thread activating instantly. I opened a mental browser, pulling up every English-to-Japanese dictionary and grammar guide I had ever read or glanced at. I scrolled through all of it, processing every word, every rule, every character in a matter of moments. A virtual map began to form in my mind, a perfect, logical link between the English syntax I knew and the Japanese I was now learning in real-time. I wasn&#39;t just memorizing; I was building a new function.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With the translation running in the background, I finally spoke.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dev, the server is fine, but the DNS is redirecting traffic to a broken IP. Just go into the admin panel; I&#39;ll send you a new one. It&#39;s an easy fix. As for the files, they weren&#39;t deleted; they were simply tagged incorrectly. I&rsquo;ll send you the recovery path. Go nail that presentation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I then looked at Suraj. &quot;The kanji here means &lsquo;execute.&rsquo; The one below it is &lsquo;condition.&rsquo; The Japanese syntax is a bit different, but if you translate them as conditional statements, it works. Give me a second.&rdquo; With my own work now complete, I typed out the corrected and translated block of code for him, a product of my new Language Thread.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dev and Suraj stood speechless for a moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How&hellip;?&rdquo; Dev stammered. &ldquo;You were just typing and listening to me at the same time. You didn&rsquo;t even look at the error message for more than a flash.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suraj looked down at the paper, then at my screen where the neat, translated block of code was waiting for him. &ldquo;And you just&hellip; learned a language in your head? It&rsquo;s not magic, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I finally looked up, a small, knowing smile on my face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not magic,&rdquo; I said simply. &quot;It&#39;s just about having the right threads running at the same time. Now before you forget, the client is waiting for you Dev.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The rest of the workday was a blur of efficiency. With the client presentation a success and the other issues resolved, my remaining tasks felt like minor footnotes. By 3:30 PM, I was in my car, driving toward Kian&#39;s school, a new thread already running: the Kian Thread, a protocol for after-school care.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I pulled up to the school and found Kian by the gate, his small backpack looking oversized on his shoulders. A smile, warm and genuine, stretched across my face. He was an endless well of questions and stories, and my threads helped me not only keep up but to be fully present with him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At home, while I gave him a plate of his favorite biscuits and a glass of milk, a Client Report Thread ran at 60% capacity. It meticulously structured the quarterly report, populating it with data from a thousand other indexed threads I had stored from the last few months. Meanwhile, a different thread was completely dedicated to Kian.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Appa, why does the sun shine?&quot; he asked, his mouth full of biscuit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My first thought, the one my mind instantly retrieved, was a highly technical explanation of nuclear fusion. &quot;It&#39;s a big ball of hot gas that makes its own light, buddy,&quot; I began, but the thread dedicated to Kian&#39;s emotional state, my Kian Empathy Thread, immediately flagged it as too complex. I saw the slight confusion in his eyes. I immediately pivoted. &quot;But what I mean is, it&#39;s like a really, really big lightbulb that God put in the sky just for us.&quot; His face lit up with understanding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Why is the sky blue?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Again, the scientific explanation of Rayleigh scattering popped into my mind. I caught it before it could leave my lips. &quot;Imagine the sky is a big, clear blanket. And the sun is a flashlight. The air is full of tiny, tiny pieces, and when the light hits those pieces, it makes the blanket look blue. It&#39;s magic!&quot; I said with a wink.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Are we going to build a new tower with my LEGOs today?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Absolutely, but bigger than yesterday&#39;s!&quot; I laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The questions were redundant, but my answers were always perfect, retrieved from the right thread and tailored to the right audience. It was a beautiful, ordinary moment, made possible only by my extraordinary mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The front door opened a few hours later, and in walked Ria, carrying a textbook and a tired smile. I paused my client report thread and activated a new one: the Ria Thread.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey, how was your day at college?&quot; I asked, pulling up a chair for her at the kitchen table. My mind, however, was already drafting an important email to my boss, a new thread running in parallel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Exhausting,&quot; she sighed, &quot;I had to present a research paper on the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy on patients with extreme trauma. The professor asked some tough questions, and I thought I messed up for a second. It&#39;s all just so draining.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, but my focus was entirely on her words. She knew how my mind worked, and she loved to test me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So, what was the professor&#39;s last question?&quot; she asked, her eyes narrowing playfully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t even need to think. My thread for the conversation had a perfect record. &quot;He asked you to explain the difference between systematic desensitization and flooding.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her eyes widened slightly, her smile a mix of relief and affection. &quot;You were listening! I was sure you were just drafting an email to your boss.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled back, the truth of her statement echoing in my head. &quot;I was doing both. But the thread for you is always the most important.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The night fell with a quiet calm. The scent of lemon tea filled the air, and Kian, having finished his homework and games, was asleep in his bed. Ria and I sat on the couch, the day&#39;s events settled, but the Yercaud problem still hung unspoken between us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had spent all afternoon running simulations. A work meeting? A conference? A sudden sickness? Each one was a new thread, but none of them felt right. The truth was, my relationship with Ria was built on too much honesty to be compromised by a convenient lie. I knew the only acceptable solution&mdash;the only thread that wouldn&#39;t fray&mdash;was to be honest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I took her hand. A fresh thread, a final check, ran through my mind. Did I even need to lie? She had never taken my problems lightly. A lie, no matter how small, was a corruption of the thread that connected us. It was a risk I was not willing to take.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked into her eyes. &quot;About the Yercaud trip,&quot; I began, my voice soft. &quot;I can&#39;t go to Salem.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She didn&#39;t get angry, didn&#39;t argue. She simply looked at me, her eyes full of understanding. &quot;Is it about my parents?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded. &quot;I could give you some excuse, but you&#39;d know. I could tell you work is busy, but the truth is, I&#39;m a coward. I don&#39;t want to go back to that house, Ria. Not yet. After everything, I just want to meet them on neutral ground. I want the first time we see them to be in Yercaud, not in the home where they threw you out.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I braced myself for her to argue, to insist we all go together, but her reaction was a surprise I hadn&#39;t prepared for. A slow, warm smile spread across her face. &quot;Aryan, I&#39;m not going to force you. The fact that you&#39;re even willing to meet them is all I ever wanted. You&#39;re trying, and that means more than you know.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Relief washed over me, a powerful thread of emotion. &quot;So, you don&#39;t mind if I just join you guys after the weekend, directly at Yercaud?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Of course not,&quot; she said, squeezing my hand. &quot;In fact, if that&#39;s what you want, we can even all go together on Monday, when you get off work.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a perfect solution, but I hesitated. &quot;No, you and Kian go ahead. Spend the weekend with your parents. I&#39;ll take a bus and meet you all there on Monday morning.&quot; I thought about the hours of quiet time I would have to work, and the mental freedom of avoiding Salem. It seemed like the best option.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Are you sure?&quot; she asked, her smile fading a little, a hint of concern in her eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m sure. I&#39;ll see you on Monday.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Little did I know that this simple decision, made out of love and fear, was the very one that set in motion the chain of events that would change my life forever. The next two weeks were perfect, a final string of memories to hold on to. I would spend those days with an ordinary kind of joy, completely unaware that the fragile thread of our perfect life was about to be severed for good.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c1 c20" id="h.mbwkesrlebzq"><span class="c23 c2">Chapter 6: Zoya&#39;s Alliance</span></h1><p class="c14"><span class="c2">6 months ago</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is this strange thing with Bengaluru traffic, or any traffic in India, for that matter. It gives you more than enough time to retrospect and look within. As I was forced to patiently navigate and push forward through the busy noise, which was nothing compared to the chaos in my mind, my thoughts just kept wavering. The undeniable fact: Aryan&#39;s week-long absence, the disappearance of his wife and son, the missing persons report filed just three days ago. Everything pointed to a dark conclusion. A man feigning ignorance of a terrible crime.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>And yet... I kept seeing his face under that tree. The vacant eyes, the self-inflicted pain. That wasn&#39;t an act. That was the face of a man in deep pain, a man whose mind was fractured. A man so broken he couldn&#39;t hold onto a single reality for more than a few days. The police officers who took a bribe to close his case could have easily dug in deeper. Three days was far too long ago. It could have been a life or</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">death situation that got swept under the rug by a careless system, but what could I say? This is the reality of our system.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I still couldn&#39;t get a read on Aryan, though. What if this elaborate mental illness was a plausible alibi, a shield for a heinous act? Was I just a fool who was falling for a sob story, as I&rsquo;ve so often seen in court? He might have known I had his Aadhaar ID, knowing I&#39;d run a check. He knew about the lawsuit, and he had my number saved. Was it an elaborate trap?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My hands tightened on the handlebars. I was riding straight into a police station to confront a corrupt system, all for a man I had every reason to believe was a criminal. But I couldn&#39;t ignore the possibility of his innocence&mdash;a possibility that meant he was suffering at this very moment because of a decision I made. This wasn&#39;t about serving a lawsuit anymore. This was a race against time&mdash;to prove my gut feeling was right, or to find out the man I&#39;d just championed was the very monster I feared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I arrived at the police station just under an hour later, at 8:30 PM. For a Bengaluru resident, driving a scooter through the relentless, horn-blaring arteries of the city and making it in under an hour was an achievement. The station, a sprawling two-story building in the heart of Electronic City, was a stark contrast to the quiet streets I&#39;d finally managed to turn into. The perimeter was lined with a half-dozen police jeeps, their sirens a silent testament to the constant flow of emergencies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Inside, the atmosphere was chaotic and vibrant, a microcosm of the city&#39;s ceaseless activity. A single ceiling fan whirred lazily above, but it was no match for the heat generated by the dozens of people packed into the main hall. The benches were all occupied. In one corner, two constables were mediating a heated argument between two men who had clearly been in a car accident. Their clothes were dusty, and their voices were loud, full of accusations. Near the front desk, a woman, her face a mask of exhaustion, was giving a statement about a bag theft on a bus. Her husband stood behind her, patting her back nervously. The air was thick with the faint smell of city dust, sweat, and a certain, indescribable mustiness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I headed straight for the Inspector&#39;s room and found Manoj Kumar inside. His uniform, though crisp, couldn&rsquo;t hide the exhaustion in his eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Zoya Ma&rsquo;am! What happened?&rdquo; he asked, a hint of annoyance in his voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip; I just wanted to speak to Aryan,&rdquo; I said, unable to come up with a better reason on the spot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looked at me, a weird chuckle escaping his lips. &ldquo;Can&#39;t get yourself to sleep, eh? You&#39;ve already put in your hours for the day, and now you want to work overtime? He&rsquo;s not going anywhere, you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No. Not after learning about the missing complaint he filed three days ago. The potential time of the crime has now shifted. If he genuinely forgot about the complaint and the incident, he could be suffering from some form of physical or mental trauma.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re a criminal lawyer after all. You can bring multiple angles to any situation; your minds are trained for that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I kept silent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But how many lawyers in this city would think like you? He may be a high-profile guy, but as you mentioned, he&rsquo;s on the verge of facing a corporate lawsuit and might end up losing every penny he has.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m not in this for the money like you guys are, I thought but didn&#39;t respond.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;...Anyway, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with hoping for the best. Besides, he might open up to a lawyer more than to a police officer. But only if he agrees to have you as his lawyer,&rdquo; he smirked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had a point. Would Aryan trust me now? Not just as a lawyer, but enough to open up? I had no idea. Police officers are the initial shield of society, which means they see the worst situations all the time. Convicted family men, corrupt businessmen, and, most importantly, greedy lawyers. I couldn&#39;t blame him for what he was thinking. They were used to it, and I was used to such behaviors too. At least he was letting me speak to Aryan. He could have easily told me to come back the next day, citing the late hour.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you so much, sir,&rdquo; I said, and this time I meant it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He nodded and asked me to wait in a nearby room. The room was exactly what I had expected: a small, utilitarian space with stark, peeling gray walls and a single, humming fluorescent light overhead that cast a sickly yellow glow. A heavy, dark-wood table with scuffed edges was bolted to the floor, flanked by two equally uninviting chairs. The air was stale and cold, carrying the faint scent of old paper and disinfectant. It was a space designed for brief, unpleasant meetings, a sterile buffer between freedom and confinement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A few minutes later, Aryan was escorted in by a constable. He was bruised, small marks here and there on his face and arms, but nothing too severe&mdash;just as Manoj had said. I had seen worse in my line of work. He looked different from the frantic man I had seen at the school; now, he seemed numb, a hollowed-out version of himself. Aryan didn&#39;t look at me at first. The constable, a stoic man with a tired expression, made him sit on a chair opposite me and stood near the door, his presence a constant, silent pressure. Aryan wasn&#39;t handcuffed, meaning he hadn&#39;t been resisting them much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mr. Jith, I think we started on the wrong foot, but as you can see, the situation isn&rsquo;t in your favor,&rdquo; I said, breaking the tense silence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He still wouldn&#39;t look at me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;All we know is that your wife and son are missing, and what you said about them leaving home this morning was a lie,&rdquo; I paused for a reaction but got none. &ldquo;As you can see, that gives everyone reason to doubt you and suspect that something worse has happened to Ria and Kian...&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The moment I finished that sentence, Aryan stood up, shaking his head. He started to shout, &ldquo;No! No! Stop this! I can&rsquo;t see this! Stop this!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was breaking down. I realized I&rsquo;d used the wrong approach; I should have led with empathy. What&#39;s wrong with me? &ldquo;Calm down, Mr. Jith, please hear me!&rdquo; Before I could finish, the constable kicked Aryan in the back, and he fell to the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stop it! Don&#39;t you dare do that in front of me!&rdquo; I shouted at the constable, my voice as strong as I could make it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But Ma&rsquo;am! He was...&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I cut him off with a glare. Aryan&rsquo;s eyes were filled with tears, not from the pain or embarrassment, but from something else. A memory, perhaps. He said he &quot;couldn&#39;t see it anymore.&quot; Was he a witness to a crime? Oh God, I have to break his shell and reach out to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I rushed to Aryan and helped him back into the chair. He stopped shouting, and his gaze finally met mine. All I could see was sorrow and unbearable pain. I had to trust my gut and be honest with him, to try one more time from my heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aryan, I am so sorry for what happened to you,&rdquo; I began. &ldquo;To be honest, I really don&#39;t think you could have done anything wrong. In fact, you could be the victim here.&rdquo; As I spoke, Aryan looked at me. Good, I&#39;m making some kind of connection.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I want to be your lawyer, and I also want to ask you this: why did you forget filing a missing person&rsquo;s case right here, three days ago?&rdquo; I had to trust him with that question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I filed a missing case here for Ria and Kian? Three days ago?&rdquo; he asked, a look of genuine shock on his face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So one thread wasn&#39;t enough,&rdquo; he murmured.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, what do you mean?&rdquo; I asked. He weakly signaled for me to stop with a hand gesture. He looked visibly tired.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Zoya Ma&rsquo;am, thank you for your sympathy towards a man who looks so wrong,&rdquo; he said, taking a shaky breath. &ldquo;Can I have a paper and a pen?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I swiftly opened my bag and gave them to him. He immediately began writing. I knew exactly what it was, an FIR number. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No 89/2024 Yercaud Town PS</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He slid the paper back to me. &ldquo;Please check this out. Once you clear your doubt about me, I need a big, unreasonable favor from you.&rdquo; With that, he stood and walked back toward the constable, who led him away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I rushed to Manoj Kumar with the paper in my hand and asked him to check it immediately. It was 9:30 PM. I explained that before calling the other station, we could check the basic details of the case on the CCTNS (Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems) online portal. As a civilian, I didn&rsquo;t have access, but Inspector Manoj Kumar could easily check it. As he was logging into the system, my mind began to connect the dots. Aryan looked different this time; there was a fragile clarity in his eyes, even through the enormous pain. I wondered what this FIR number was for&mdash;a previous crime of his? Or the actual case of what happened to Ria? It only took a moment to realize the latter was the terrifying truth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh! Now I get it,&rdquo; Manoj sighed in a mix of relief and dread.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked, my heart pounding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say it, but it&#39;s bad news. Ria was murdered. This FIR is for that same case, which happened seven days ago. The relief is that Aryan is not the suspect. In fact, the FIR reports him as the second victim.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was stunned. He was a victim. He had witnessed something&mdash;hence the trauma inside his head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Manoj continued, &ldquo;You see, we searched the CCTNS portal for Aryan&rsquo;s Aadhaar earlier, but this case never showed up. Now I realize that Aryan was neither the suspect nor the main complainant.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then who is? And what happened to Kian?&rdquo; I asked, still overwhelmed by the information.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A Mr. Viswanathan is the complainant, and there&rsquo;s no mention of Kian in the FIR. We&rsquo;ll need to reach out to the Yercaud station for any further details,&rdquo; he said professionally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can we do that now?&rdquo; I couldn&#39;t wait.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, we can. But first, we need to understand the trouble we&#39;re in. We just took custody of a victim, and if he complains against us, anything could happen,&rdquo; he said, now afraid for his own job. I couldn&#39;t blame him; I had dragged him into this. We were both responsible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now is not the time to think about it, Manoj sir! The first thing we need to do to get into his good books is to get him to a hospital. I believe he&#39;s suffering from some form of PTSD&mdash;Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.&rdquo; I used the phrase &quot;good books&quot; to make him act immediately and willingly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, definitely! After all this, we&#39;ll do it right away,&rdquo; he agreed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good. And don&#39;t worry. He made me his lawyer, and in this current situation, whatever you guys did to him is nothing compared to what he&rsquo;s already been through over the last seven days,&rdquo; I assured him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Manoj nodded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So while I&#39;m taking him to a hospital, please reach out to that station and get all the details about the case.&rdquo; After assuring his safety, I asked for a favor he couldn&#39;t refuse.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went to meet Aryan, though I had no idea how to initiate a conversation with him. What we had done was absolutely wrong. We had harassed a victim. There was no point in trying to fight this; I made up my mind to agree to any favor Aryan might ask. I hoped he wasn&#39;t looking for revenge or justice from his own hands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Aryan was sitting inside the same room. They might have moved him there immediately after they learned he was not a criminal. He looked very tired and drowsy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We will be moving you to a hospital now, Mr. Jith,&rdquo; I started.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So now you know. Anyway, no hospital can help me,&rdquo; he paused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But, Mr. Jith&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Call me Aryan,&rdquo; he said, struggling to speak. &ldquo;You see, Zoya Ma&rsquo;am, when something happens in front of you, we can close our eyes and not see it. But if it is etched into your memory, even if you plucked your eyes out, you can&#39;t stop seeing it.&rdquo; He suddenly raised his voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Aryan continued, still struggling, &ldquo;My memory is different. I can remember things a bit more than normal, sometimes throughout my lifetime.&rdquo; He stopped speaking as he was seeing it again&mdash;the scene he never wanted to see again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We will get justice, Aryan!&rdquo; I said, my own tears rolling down my eyes. Aryan was crying in pain. He was going through something extremely painful. His memory&mdash;remembering my name and number from four years ago... If he could do that, I couldn&#39;t imagine how clearly he was visualizing what happened seven days ago. The gift he had his entire life had turned into a curse, and now he couldn&#39;t stop reliving the trauma. I was no one here, yet even I couldn&#39;t stop crying, and I couldn&#39;t imagine what he had seen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I somehow managed to speak. &ldquo;We can give you medicine and put you to sleep.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;For how long? I have infinite memory! And even when I sleep, my threads don&#39;t stop hearing!&rdquo; he raised his voice again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&#39;t understand what you&rsquo;re saying, but we need you to help solve Ria&#39;s case.&rdquo; I hoped this might bring him some focus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I won&#39;t be of any help. I was never able to do anything then, or even now! I am weak, I am useless, and pathetic.&rdquo; He paused and then looked at me. &ldquo;Look, Zoya Ma&rsquo;am, I already told them what I know, every single detail, and they even said they almost caught the suspect!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know I am pathetic, but I must live. I can&#39;t see these things anymore. I need your help. I can&#39;t do this alone! It&rsquo;s a big burden to ask a stranger, but I...&rdquo; He was struggling. &ldquo;I can&#39;t do this alone!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I will do anything to help you and Ria&#39;s case...&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ria is gone! I should be gone too, but I can&#39;t die, Ma&#39;am. Have you ever been ordered by someone you love? Ria&#39;s last order to me was, &lsquo;I must live, this pathetic, lame man must live.&rsquo; It&#39;s the same thing my mom said before she left me. What a coincidence. Both of them gave me the exact same order before leaving.&rdquo; Aryan kept crying.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay, Aryan, what should I do now?&rdquo; I asked, genuinely wanting to help him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have a way to reset myself, to erase anything that happened in the last few days. My limit is 14 days. Last week, I reset myself for only three days: Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. Ria and Kian went to her parents&#39; place last Friday and usually come back by Monday. So every third day, I assumed they had already arrived home and left for school before I woke up. I reset myself twice this week already, living within this three-day loop. That&#39;s why I missed going to the office; I usually don&#39;t go to the office on those three days.&rdquo; He paused to let this sink in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As weird as it sounded, now many of the things that had happened in the last week, especially today, made a terrifying kind of sense. My mind, trained to find the rational explanation, was instead confronted with a truth so impossible it could only be real. He wasn&#39;t faking it; he was actively, brutally, and systematically destroying his own memory to survive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But I realized one thing,&rdquo; he continued, his voice a strained whisper. &ldquo;I can&#39;t keep living within this three-day loop, and I can&#39;t do it without external help. That&#39;s where I need your help...&rdquo; Aryan&#39;s nose started bleeding again, a thin trickle becoming a steady flow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aryan! What happened to your nose?!&rdquo; I started, but he cut me short. He wiped the blood from his nose and signaled with his hand for me to stop. &ldquo;I have to finish explaining this. I am already using two more threads to speak, think, and build up this entire conversation. The nosebleed could be the side effect of that.&rdquo; He was making no sense again, and yet, in the face of his physical pain, it all felt terribly, tragically real.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My limit for a reset is 14 days. Ria and Kian had been to her parents&#39; place in Salem even two weeks back too. So before every reset, I will register a thread believing that they will only be back after two weeks. These two weeks will go normally for me. On the fourteenth day at 3:30 PM, I will go to pick up Kian, No matter what! And I need your help to convince Mufta Ma&#39;am to tell me that my wife has already picked up Kian. I might be confused, but at least I won&rsquo;t react in public. By the end of the day, I would reset myself automatically with my reset thread. And in some cases, if I realize my reality is fabricated and I get back into the trauma, I will hard reset immediately.&rdquo; He finished.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It took me a long, silent moment to piece these things together. My mind, a lawyer&#39;s mind, a mind of logic and precedent, was reeling. The complexity of his &quot;solution&quot; was staggering. He was asking me to become a conspirator in his self-deception, to lie to the headmistress of his son&rsquo;s school, all to protect him from a truth he had to forget to survive. I had only one question: &ldquo;Even if whatever you told me is sanely possible, can you keep living like this, the same 14 days, for your entire life?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s not the same 14 days, Zoya Ma&rsquo;am. At least not for you guys. For me, since the memories of these days are erased, I won&#39;t think of it as the same 14 days either,&rdquo; he replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know it sounds insane, and the way I&#39;m going to live is cowardly, but I must live! It&rsquo;s a very big ask for a stranger&hellip;&rdquo; His nose started bleeding again. &ldquo;I need to reset now. Can I trust you?&rdquo; He finally spoke like he had initially, struggling and tired.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; I had to say yes, even if I didn&#39;t believe everything he had said. The word was a reflex, an emotional commitment made before my logical mind could raise a single objection. To my surprise, he became unconscious. His body simply gave in, collapsing as if a vital power source had been cut. As he had requested, I asked a police constable to drop him home and help him get to bed. Inspector Manoj Kumar, relieved to be off the hook, was more than happy to help.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next day was a blur of damage control. First, I spoke to two people at Aryan&#39;s firm: his boss, Mathew, and his friend, Dev. I explained Aryan&#39;s situation, choosing my words carefully to convey the gravity of his trauma without revealing the impossible truth of his &quot;resets.&quot; Legally, the lawsuit was no longer applicable; the past week could be considered Bereavement Leave. Moreover, the prospect of having their top employee return to work, even under these strange circumstances, was a massive relief for the firm. Both men felt a profound sadness for him. Dev, who already had some awareness of Aryan&rsquo;s &quot;thread&quot; concept, easily grasped the depth of his suffering and wept openly for his friend.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My next stop was Kian&rsquo;s school. The headmistress, Mufta Ma&rsquo;am, was a woman of quiet dignity. I sat in her office and explained that Ria had been a dear friend, and that her death had left a profound and lasting impact on Aryan, a trauma he was trying to navigate in a very specific way. She listened with a heavy heart, her eyes welling with tears. Her first question was, &ldquo;What about Kian?&rdquo; The worry for the little boy was plain on her face. I promised her I would be his guardian in a way, that I was working to ensure he was safe, and that I would share more information with her when the time was right. It was a half-truth, but it was enough. She agreed to cooperate, promising to tell Aryan that Ria had already picked up Kian whenever he came to the school gate on the fourteenth day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so, a new routine began. A life built on a foundation of orchestrated deception.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Six months passed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The six months became a strange cycle for me. Every fourteenth day, I would get a call from Mufta Ma&rsquo;am. I&rsquo;d receive the call while sitting in my office, or in the car, or at home, and I would know exactly what was happening. I felt this was the least I could do for Aryan after making him go through the unbearable pain. I met Aryan several times during these six months, at his office and home, just to check on him. But every 14 days, he would forget me, and I would have to reintroduce myself. The first few times were jarring. The polite, genuine confusion in his eyes, the handshake that was both familiar and brand-new. It was a relationship built on a recurring first impression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I used to wonder, though, what about Kian? Why didn&#39;t Aryan ever seem worried or concerned? It struck me as odd, and I always thought I should do something about it. Then, the truth dawned on me. It was the other way around. For Aryan to make the conscious decision to reset his memories&mdash;a decision that meant forgetting his own son&#39;s situation&mdash;there could only be two possibilities. Either he knew Kian was dead, or he was safe somewhere and, in his current state, Aryan couldn&#39;t do anything about it. Just as he had seemingly made peace with Ria&#39;s murder&mdash;because the culprits were behind bars&mdash;he must have made peace with Kian&#39;s situation before resorting to the reset option.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The irony was a quiet, constant ache in my heart. I was getting closer to him every day, learning to predict his emotional state, anticipating his needs, while he completely forgot about me every 14 days. I would listen to him talk about Ria and Kian, hearing the same stories as if for the first time. But overall, he looked happy. I could see a genuine smile on his face whenever he greeted me, a smile that was not there in that police station. This look suited him well, and I would do anything to keep him from falling into the same state of profound, mind-shattering sorrow I had witnessed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c2">Present Day (A little later to Mufta&rsquo;s call)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3">Ring! Ring!</span></p><p class="c1"><span>The insistent jangle of my phone startled me out of my thoughts. The clock on my desktop showed 4:00 PM. I looked at the caller ID. </span><span class="c3">Arvind.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;It was my assistant. I had given him a new pro bono case to look into and get some details for me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hi, Zoya Ma&rsquo;am! Arvind here,&rdquo; he chirped, sounding a little too cheerful for my liking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know who you are! I have your number!&rdquo; I replied, trying to sound jovial, though a part of me was already tired of the day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ha ha ha! Okay, Ma&rsquo;am. I got the primary FIR number and other details for the pro bono case you asked me to look into,&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay, just email me the details,&rdquo; I said, and disconnected the call.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I opened my computer to check the email, this was a case I had recently taken up on a whim. The two convicted men were brothers from a very poor background. Their parents had come to me, insisting their sons were involved in smaller crimes but not a heinous murder. My initial background study came out exactly as their parents had told me. So I felt pity and asked my assistant to dig deeper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I opened my Outlook inbox, and there was one unread mail.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3">Subject Line: FIR No 89/2024 Yercaud Town PS.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My blood ran cold. My heart slammed against my ribs, a single, thunderous beat. The world around me seemed to tilt on its axis. The FIR number. It was the same one Aryan had scrawled on the paper with a bleeding nose. The same one that had told me about Ria&#39;s murder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How was it possible? How could this very FIR number, the core of Aryan&rsquo;s tragedy, be connected to my new pro bono case?</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c20 c40" id="h.ayk68mwiv45g"><span class="c23 c2">Chapter 7: Life inside Reset</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Present Day (At the start of a new reset loop for Aryan)</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2 c3">T0: </span><span class="c3">&ldquo;Look at this fool! Living his life in a loop! Pathetic! Wait till it&#39;s my turn! No matter how deep you keep me hidden! I am the shadow which follows you even in darkness! I will break free! I don&rsquo;t care about your present family! I will find Mom!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3">&quot;BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The harsh, unrelenting sound of the alarm clock tore through the unsettling echo of the voice. My eyes snapped open, a jolt of adrenaline still coursing through me. The clock on my nightstand glowed with the cursed, unchangeable number: 8:00 a.m. I lay there for a moment, a strange feeling settling on me like a shroud. The day had begun again. It was a thought, not a certainty, but a feeling I couldn&#39;t shake. The world felt... off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I pushed myself up, the springs of the mattress silent beneath me. The taste of stale defeat was in my mouth, a feeling that made no sense. I had no reason to feel defeated. Yet, the feeling was there, a phantom flavor. The day&#39;s routine felt familiar before it even began. The same strong coffee, the same quiet walk, the same predictable conversations with the same people. It wasn&#39;t repetition I was aware of, but the overwhelming sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. Every moment felt like a playback of a scene I had already lived. The sheer weight of this feeling was a physical thing, a crushing pressure on my chest that made each breath feel like a chore.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My thoughts drifted to Ria and Kian. They had left for Salem on Friday night to visit her parents, and this time they will stay for 2 weeks there, I missed them more than I expected. It was Monday now, and the house was far too quiet. I picked up my phone, the ingrained habit of a loving husband and father kicking in. I dialed Ria&#39;s number, but after a few rings, I was met with her voicemail. I sighed, leaving a quick message. &quot;Hey, Ria. Just checking in. Give me a call when you get a chance. Love you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I placed the phone down, it immediately rang again, this time with Dev&#39;s name flashing on the screen. &quot;Aryan, bro, where are you? Get to the office. We&#39;ve got a surprise client meeting in thirty minutes. Mathew is on his way to present something, and he wants you to be there.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;On my way,&quot; I said, a sense of purpose replacing the dull ache of repetition. I was still missing my family, but a client meeting was a welcome distraction. I began to get ready, my mind already running through the potential presentation points. As I knotted my tie, my hand hovered over the TV remote. My threads, my unique way of multitasking, were already firing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T2</span><span class="c3">: &ldquo;Listen to the news. We need to catch up on the morning briefing.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a voice in my head instructed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But another thread, sharper and more insistent, interrupted. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T4</span><span class="c7 c3">: &ldquo;Cancel that. No time. Dev is waiting!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I paused, a flicker of confusion crossing my mind. My hand fell away from the remote. The news could wait. Dev was right, the CEO&#39;s meeting was more important.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T5</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;to </span><span class="c2 c3">T4</span><span class="c3">: &ldquo;Good call. Watching News is risky, We need to stay focused. No distractions&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The news remained a silent screen. I grabbed my briefcase and headed for the door, the unsettling feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu still present, but now buried under the press of a busy Monday morning.</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The office was a familiar hum of activity. The smell of fresh coffee and the distant chattering of people filled the space. Dev was waiting for me in my cabin, a mixture of relief and amusement on his face. &quot;Good, you&#39;re here. Sorry, man, meeting&#39;s been postponed. A last-minute issue came up with the presentation deck.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A flicker of annoyance crossed my mind, but it was quickly replaced by the sense of something else. This conversation felt... rehearsed. Like a scene I had already performed. &quot;No problem. I can get some work done,&quot; I said, putting my briefcase on the desk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just then, a knock on the door, and before I could even say &quot;come in,&quot; a woman with a confident stride entered. She was stylish, with a sharp, professional air about her. I had no idea who she was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Aryan Jith?&quot; she asked, her voice clear and precise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s me,&quot; I replied, a thread of confusion weaving its way through my thoughts. &quot;Can I help you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She smiled, a disarming, practiced smile. &quot;Hi. My name is Zoya. We had an appointment. I called you on Saturday.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>The words hit me with a jolt. I had no memory of this call, no memory of making an appointment. Yet, the information was there, bubbling up from some deeper recess of my mind. The name, Zoya Kiran, and even her phone number, 9845-XXXXXX, appeared in my mental archive. I remembered seeing it on a printout of my firm&#39;s legal team from four years ago, a document I had glanced at once when I was promoted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Zoya Kiran,&quot; I said, the name rolling off my tongue with a strange familiarity. &quot;And your number is 9845-XXXXXX.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zoya and Dev shared a quick, knowing look, their smiles identical. Dev&#39;s smile I could understand; he was used to my eidetic memory, my talent for recalling details others would miss. But Zoya&#39;s? It was the smile of someone who was expecting me to do exactly that. The d&eacute;j&agrave; vu feeling intensified, wrapping around me like a cold, tightening wire. </span></p><hr><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T5</span><span class="c7 c3">: &quot;She&#39;s here to meet him immediately after the reset? Is she getting too close?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T4</span><span class="c7 c3">: &quot;She&#39;s just doing her job. Nothing to worry about.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T5</span><span class="c7 c3">: &quot;Hmm, and Dev is doing a fine job of making up excuses to get Aryan out of the house.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T4</span><span class="c3">: &quot;You&#39;re talking more than usual. Be careful, </span><span class="c2 c3">T1</span><span class="c7 c3">&nbsp;might hear us.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T5</span><span class="c3">: &quot;I am a hidden thread. The numbered threads&mdash;</span><span class="c2 c3">T1</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c2 c3">T2</span><span class="c3">, and </span><span class="c2 c3">T3</span><span class="c7 c3">&mdash;are unaware of my existence. Our conversation is also hidden.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T4</span><span class="c7 c3">: &quot;So you wipe my memory during the reset and then use me, a numbered thread, to manipulate the others?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T5</span><span class="c7 c3">: &ldquo;You caught on faster this time!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T4</span><span class="c7 c3">: &quot;So are you controlling the resets? Do you have the memory of what happened before the resets? Or is it completely gone?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T5</span><span class="c7 c3">: &quot;No, I don&rsquo;t control the resets. I am also just following the rules laid out for me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T4</span><span class="c3">: &quot;So you&#39;re not at the top of the chain? There&#39;s a </span><span class="c2 c3">T6</span><span class="c7 c3">, or more?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T5</span><span class="c7 c3">: &quot;....&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T4</span><span class="c7 c3">: &quot;I get it, it&#39;s classified. But can you at least tell me if you have the memory of what happened before the loop began?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T5</span><span class="c7 c3">: &quot;Nothing can be completely removed from memory unless there&#39;s a hard reset. But we can remove the index from the Index thread, so you won&#39;t know where to look. I, too, am unaware of what&#39;s in that memory or why these resets are happening.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T4</span><span class="c7 c3">: &quot;Fine. I&#39;ll continue to do my duty, no matter how long it takes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T5</span><span class="c7 c3">: &quot;Good.&quot;</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c7 c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c7 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zoya stepped forward and offered a firm handshake. &quot;It&#39;s a pleasure to finally meet you, Mr. Jith. I&#39;ve been assigned to you as your personal legal advisor. Just came by to introduce myself and get to know you a bit. Honestly, I&#39;ve heard so much about your brain&mdash;it&#39;s practically a legend in our firm. The way you can process and recall information... It&#39;s a game-changer. They say you&#39;re a human supercomputer.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A wave of relief washed over me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T4</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;to </span><span class="c2 c3">T1</span><span class="c3">: The reaction is because of your fame, not your predicament. All clear.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was it. Her lack of surprise wasn&#39;t because she knew about the deeper strangeness of my life; it was because she had heard about my &quot;super computer brain,&quot; the nickname my colleagues had given my eidetic memory. As Zoya continued to talk, praising my unique skill set, a different kind of thread, a far more mundane and human one, began to fire in my mind. She was confident, attractive, and clearly impressed. Was she... was she interested? The thought was absurd, but the thread persisted. It was the kind of insecurity that made me feel like a teenager again. I needed to nip this in the bud.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s great to meet you, too, Zoya,&quot; I said, trying to sound casual. &quot;You know, all of this is just an elaborate trick. The real reason I&#39;m a good Director of Technology is because I have a great support system at home. My wife, Ria, and my son, Kian, are actually out of the city right now. They&#39;re visiting her parents. It&#39;s nice to have a little quiet time, but I miss them like crazy. Happy family life, all that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I watched as both Zoya and Dev&#39;s smiles widened, a knowing amusement dancing in their eyes. They exchanged another look, and then a shared laugh escaped them. It wasn&rsquo;t a mean laugh, but a gentle, affectionate one directed entirely at me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zoya shook her head, still smiling. &quot;Oh, Aryan. Don&#39;t worry. Everyone at my firm knows about your romantic &#39;endeavor.&#39; In fact, it&#39;s a huge topic of gossip.&quot; She turned to Dev. &quot;Didn&#39;t you tell him his love story is a famous legend in both our firms?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dev, still chuckling, nodded. &quot;Of course, I did! I tell everyone who&#39;s new here. The whole story about how you two met in a campus interview, and how you made her follow you to this city without a job, the fake offer letter and so much...&quot; He trailed off, laughing again. &quot;It&#39;s a great story. You should actually write a love story about it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I felt my cheeks flush with embarrassment. The awkwardness was a physical sensation, a heat spreading through my face and neck. They had seen right through my clumsy attempt to put up a wall. &quot;Right,&quot; I mumbled, clearing my throat. &quot;My apologies. That was... silly of me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zoya&#39;s smile was genuine now, a kind one that put me slightly at ease. &quot;No need to apologize. I just wanted to say hi. I&#39;ll let you get back to work. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve got a lot on your plate.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that, she gave a little nod and left the cabin, followed by a still-amused Dev. I was alone again, the awkwardness still lingering in the air. The feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu was still there, too, but now it was tinged with the familiar, humbling reality that even in this strange, repeating life, some things&mdash;like my own social awkwardness&mdash;were always, maddeningly, the same.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>A wave of relief washed over me. The rest of the day was a blur of code, client-specific enhancements, and bug fixes for the JIT framework I&#39;d created. At 3:30 p.m., a familiar notification from </span><span class="c2">T2</span><span>&mdash;a sort of internal muscle memory&mdash;ticked in, reminding me to pick up Kian from school. But just as quickly, </span><span class="c2">T4</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;relaxed my focus, reminding me that Ria and Kian were still out of town. The weight of an empty house was replaced by the simple purpose of work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By 5:00 p.m., I was ready to leave. My mind was already on the traffic I&#39;d face, and the quiet dinner I&#39;d have alone. As I walked out of the office, I noticed Zoya standing by the curb, her expression a mix of impatience and frustration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Everything okay?&quot; I asked, stopping near her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She sighed, a small smile playing on her lips. &quot;Just waiting for a cab. My scooter is in the service center today, so I&#39;m stuck with these guys.&quot; She gestured vaguely at the congested road.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, I&#39;m heading towards the metro station,&quot; I said, gesturing to my car. &quot;It&#39;s on my way. I can drop you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Are you sure?&quot; she asked, her eyebrows raised in polite hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Of course,&quot; I said with a genuine smile. &quot;I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t want to spend your evening fighting for a cab. My car is right here.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She considered it for a moment, then nodded. &quot;Thank you, Aryan. That&#39;s very kind of you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She got in, and as I pulled out of the parking lot and into the familiar, chaotic Bengaluru traffic, a different kind of thread began to spin in my mind. It was a thread of quiet conversation, a shared space in the car, and a moment that felt, for the first time today, genuinely new. The script of the day had been broken, if only by a simple act of courtesy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were almost out of the company&rsquo;s main gate when the car in front of me slammed on its brakes without warning. My instincts took over, and I hit the brake pedal as hard as I could. The tires screeched, but it wasn&#39;t enough. With a jarring crunch, my car&#39;s bumper met the car in front. The impact wasn&#39;t severe, but the force of my foot on the brake lever had shifted the pedal, trapping my leg and a searing, white-hot pain shot through my foot. A gasp of pain escaped my lips as I saw the horrifying sight of my own toe bent at an unnatural, sickening angle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Almost instantly, a new thread, born of a desperate, primal instinct, fired. </span><span class="c2 c3">Pain Suppress Thread Activated.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The blinding, searing fire of pain instantly dampened. It wasn&#39;t gone, not completely, but it was muted, like a radio volume being turned down. I could feel the injury, but the signal of &quot;pain&quot; was now just a dull throb.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dev, who had been driving just behind us, skidded to a halt. He rushed out of his car, his face a mask of worry. Zoya, who was in the passenger seat next to me, was already asking if I was okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Aryan, your leg!&quot; Dev exclaimed, as he opened my door, his eyes fixed on my visibly broken toe. &quot;You&#39;re bleeding! And your toe&hellip; it&#39;s bent! You should be in agony!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked down at my foot, then back at them. &quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; I said, the words feeling strange. &quot;I just... I suppressed it. It&#39;s a new thread. The Pain Suppress Thread.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dev&#39;s eyes widened, a look of utter amazement replacing his concern. &quot;Your threads had this feature, too? Since when? I&#39;ve never seen you do that.&quot; He looked at Zoya. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;This was the first.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I rubbed my chin, a new wave of confusion washing over me. I had just said it was a new skill, but somewhere, deep in the fragmented archives of my mind, a faint echo of a memory stirred. I had a feeling I had done this before. The feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu intensified, no longer a gentle hum, but a jarring alarm bell. I had done this before, and it hadn&#39;t been in this loop. It had been somewhere else, some time else, for some other reason. And for the life of me, I couldn&#39;t remember why.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zoya, despite her initial shock, was already acting. &quot;We need to get you to a hospital. Now. Dev, is there a good one nearby?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;There&#39;s a hospital just a couple of kilometers down the road,&quot; Dev said, his voice still filled with disbelief.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Okay,&quot; Zoya said, taking charge. &quot;You get in Dev&#39;s car. I&#39;ll ride with you. Dev, can you drive?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dev nodded, and without another word, he reached out to help me, but I shook my head. &quot;It&#39;s okay. I really don&#39;t feel the pain now.&quot; I looked down at my foot, then back at them. &quot;Pain is just a signal from the nerve endings in the affected area, telling the brain that something is wrong. The thread is just cutting that signal, preventing it from ever reaching my brain.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that, I pushed the car door open, jumped out, and walked towards Dev&#39;s car, my steps completely normal despite my mangled toe. Dev and Zoya simply stared, awe-struck at what they were seeing. My skill with threads was one thing, but this was on a whole new level.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I got into the passenger seat of Dev&#39;s car, I heard him say to Zoya in a hushed, disbelieving tone, &quot;How is he even doing this... if this is not magic...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We all clambered into his car, the broken fender of my car a silent testament to the strange turn the day had taken. The pain was still a dull throb, a faint echo of what should have been, and the feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu was a growing, unsettling hum.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T4</span><span class="c7 c3">: &quot;Care to explain what just happened?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T5</span><span class="c7 c3">: &quot;It&#39;s like he said. Pain is just a signal from the nerve endings in the affected area, telling the brain that something is wrong. The thread simply cut that signal.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T4</span><span class="c7 c3">: &quot;Thanks for repeating him. I&#39;m talking about the thread itself. When was this created? We weren&#39;t aware of this.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T5</span><span class="c7 c3">: &quot;I was aware of its presence. I activated it when the pain became unbearable.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T4</span><span class="c7 c3">: &quot;I figured that much. So you must know when this was first created.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T5</span><span class="c7 c3">: &quot;Before the reset, I believe. Since you have no information, and there&#39;s no memory index pointing to the origin of the Pain Suppress Thread, that&#39;s the only thing that makes sense.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T4</span><span class="c7 c3">: &quot;So we&#39;re still in the dark. I guess we&#39;re kept out of the loop for a reason.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">T5</span><span class="c3">: &quot;....&quot;</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were rushed into the hospital that Dev had mentioned. The doctors took one look at my visibly bent toe and the blood seeping through my shoe, their faces growing serious. After a quick examination, they were firm: a minor surgery was necessary, and it needed to be done immediately. There was no other option.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With my family away, Zoya stepped up without a moment&#39;s hesitation. &quot;I&#39;ll stay with him,&quot; she said to the doctor, her voice calm and assured. &quot;I&#39;m his legal advisor.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I couldn&#39;t help but feel a surge of gratitude. For a person who had only met me this morning, she was being incredibly caring. My mind, still processing the day&#39;s bizarre events, didn&#39;t want to doubt her intentions, especially since the awkward romantic angle had been cleared up. Dev, too, stood by us, running errands for the staff and making sure everything was in order.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>As the nurse prepped me for surgery, giving me a local anesthetic, my thoughts drifted, and the familiar feeling of sleep began to overtake me. Yet, my mind didn&#39;t shut down completely. My threads, my unique abilities, had a special function even when I was unconscious. My </span><span class="c2">T2</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;thread, the one for memory and retrieval, didn&#39;t sleep. It could still record anything happening around me that my ears could pick up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I smiled inwardly, a memory from college surfacing. I&rsquo;d used this exact skill to pass a difficult semester exam. My best friend, Rohit, and I were hostel roommates. I was a procrastinator; he was a machine of discipline. The night before the exam, I was completely unprepared. I knew I couldn&#39;t stay awake, so I made him a deal. I&#39;d fall asleep, but he had to promise to read his notes aloud as he studied. Our beds were lined up in the dorm, and he was studying just a few feet away. I made him promise not to stop, even when I started snoring, which was exactly what I did. But Rohit, being the good friend he was, kept his word. My </span><span class="c2">T2</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;thread silently recorded every word, every formula, every detail. I woke up the next morning and aced the exam, a surprise to everyone. Dev, my junior and friend for the last six years, still doesn&#39;t know about this particular skill of mine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>A mischievous idea sparked in my fading consciousness. I&#39;d bet he&#39;ll be talking to Zoya while I&#39;m out. </span><span class="c2">T2</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;will record it all. When I wake up, I&#39;ll surprise him by repeating everything he says, finally revealing this little secret of mine. I thought, a last flicker of consciousness before the darkness claimed me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sounds of the hospital room began to filter back in&mdash;the low hum of the air conditioner, the rhythmic beeping of the monitor beside the bed. Zoya was a presence nearby, and then, the soft click of the door opening and closing announced Dev&#39;s arrival.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;How is he?&quot; Dev asked quietly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Looks fine. Deep sleep,&quot; Zoya replied, her voice a low murmur. &quot;I guess they gave him some pain killers.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dev chuckled softly, the sound weary. &quot;Does he even need one? The way he just...&quot; he trailed off, the rest of the sentence lost in a heavy sigh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A moment of silence passed between them. Finally, Dev spoke again, his voice tinged with a deep sadness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Poor guy,&quot; he said. &quot;You know, I&#39;ve known him for six years, and every day he surprises me with his skills. He makes every day interesting.&quot; He paused, his voice dropping slightly. &quot;But these last six months... I can&#39;t even imagine the pain he&#39;s gone through. The biggest pain of all will be Ria&#39;s demise. Compared to that, these physical pains are nothing for him&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Zoya&#39;s reply came after a long, somber pause. &quot;That&#39;s why he&#39;s using his threads yet again, just like today. It&#39;s his own way of taking a painkiller for trauma.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dev&#39;s voice was a mixture of awe and pity. &quot;How do you handle it? He keeps forgetting you every fourteen days, and you have to introduce yourself to him all over again.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;A small price to pay from my side,&quot; Zoya said softly. &quot;To keep him sane.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Thank you,&quot; Dev said, his voice thick with emotion. &quot;Really.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No need,&quot; Zoya said. &quot;It&#39;s been six months now. Even, I&#39;m his close friend now! even though he doesn&#39;t remember me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>As my </span><span class="c2">T2</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;thread continued to record every word, a small, solitary stream of tears started rolling down from my right eye, unnoticed by Zoya and Dev.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c7 c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c1 c20" id="h.7cgg8mbyteiz"><span class="c23 c2">Chapter 8: Zoya&rsquo;s New Purpose</span></h1><p class="c14"><span class="c2 c17">One Day before the accident (Present Day)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c3">Subject Line: FIR No 89/2024 Yercaud Town PS.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The email was just staring at me, the subject line a jarring command. The case file, a PDF, felt longer than its few pages should have been. I&rsquo;d been given a new FIR for my pro bono case&mdash;a homicide&mdash;and the details were a cold, hard slap to the face. The victim: Ria Jith.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A wave of dread washed over me, cold and suffocating. A low hum of disbelief filled my mind, drowning out the usual office chatter. This couldn&rsquo;t be right. My pro bono case, a chance to help people who couldn&rsquo;t afford legal aid, was a murder investigation involving the family of someone I know. Aryan was more than just a client now. He was a friend. He was&hellip; someone I spent most of my time with. The thought was enough to send my mind spiraling, battling a fresh wave of turmoil. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My first thought wasn&#39;t for the case itself, but for him. A wave of unease washed over me, a nauseating combination of guilt and fear. What would he think? That I was some ambulance chaser, trying to get close to him to gain from his tragedy? That I was taking advantage of his grief? The thought of his trusting, confused eyes turning to suspicion filled me with a deep, unsettling dread. He already saw the world in a strange, disjointed way. I didn&#39;t want to be another reason for him to lose faith in reality. How could I even face him again, knowing I was looking into the murder of his wife? Would he misunderstand my intentions? Would he see this as a betrayal?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Why do I even care what he thinks?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The question echoed in the quiet space of my mind, unsettling me. My concern wasn&#39;t just professional; it was personal. Was I developing feelings for him? Was that even right, given the bizarre, cyclical nature of his life? I didn&rsquo;t have the answer, and the uncertainty felt just as heavy as the file itself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For a long, quiet moment, I was paralyzed by my own conflicted feelings. My heart told me to drop the case. My gut told me to run and tell him the truth. But then, my training and my core belief as a legal representative took over. I looked at the names of my new clients, two young men with no record, being accused of a crime with no apparent motive. The case details were murky, full of holes. And a chilling possibility began to form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hard at work, as usual?&quot; a voice broke through my thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I flinched, my hand instinctively slamming the laptop shut. Sanjay stood there, a practiced, almost too-friendly smile on his face. Unlike the other lawyers at our firm who only saw billable hours, Sanjay at least pretended to care about the &quot;good work&quot; we did, a desperate attempt to be on my good side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Just going through some emails,&quot; I said, the lie feeling flimsy even to my own ears.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He glanced at the laptop, then back at me. &quot;Another pro bono case? I don&#39;t know how you do it. While everyone else is just chasing the money, you&#39;re the only one trying to make a real difference.&quot; His voice was smooth, a layer of admiration thinly veiling a clear agenda.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He leaned against my desk, crossing his arms. &quot;Haven&#39;t seen you much lately, actually. You&#39;ve been pretty wrapped up with that new client. What&#39;s his name again... Aryan Jith?&quot; His voice was casual, but a hint of something else&mdash;curiosity, suspicion, a deep-seated jealousy&mdash;was in his tone. &quot;That guy seems a bit&hellip; weird. And kinda creepy, honestly. Why do you spend so much time with him?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I bristled. &quot;He&#39;s just a client, Sanjay. A difficult case.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sanjay just chuckled, shaking his head. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m sure. It&#39;s just... I did a bit of digging. You know, from my internal sources.&quot; He lowered his voice conspiratorially. &quot;I found out his wife is dead. And from what I hear, he&#39;s just living his life like nothing happened. Happy, normal. Pretty strange for a guy whose wife was murdered, right? And even stranger that you&#39;d spend so much time with a guy like that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My blood ran cold. He knew about Ria. He had a piece of the truth, but twisted and incomplete. How could I explain that Aryan wasn&rsquo;t a monster? That his happiness was a lie? That his normalcy was a carefully constructed facade for a broken mind? There was no way to justify it without sounding insane.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;He&#39;s my client, Sanjay. Nothing more,&quot; I said, my voice clipped. I grabbed my bag and stood up. &quot;I have to go. Meeting someone.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I walked away from him and his questions, the lie a tight knot in my throat. As I hurried out of the office, away from the chattering lawyers and the judgmental stares, the internal conflict from earlier evaporated. Sanjay&#39;s words, his casual accusations, had brought it all into sharp focus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This wasn&#39;t about my feelings for Aryan. It wasn&#39;t about what he would think of me. It wasn&#39;t even about my friendship with him. The case, the new FIR sitting unread on my laptop, was about justice. If these two men were innocent, then the real murderers were still out there. They were walking free, with no one even looking for them. And Aryan believed they were behind bars. &ldquo;they almost caught the suspect!&rdquo; his words echoed in my head. The peace he&rsquo;d found, the ability to survive in whatever strange reality he was trapped in, was built on a lie. A lie I was now in a position to expose. The conflict in my mind, the tug-of-war between my feelings for him and my duty, was now resolved. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had to tell him. But not like this. Not as a stranger bearing terrible news.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My mind raced. The only way to get close to him was to be there when the reset cycle began again. I had to be the first face he saw, the one he could trust from the very start. I had to build a relationship with him, one that could withstand the truth when I finally revealed it. I had to beat the clock, the invisible force that wiped his memory and kept him from the truth.</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I walked down the corridor, the familiar sounds of the office a backdrop to my own racing thoughts. He was inside, I knew that.I paused outside his cabin, taking a deep breath to steady myself. This was it. The start of a new loop. Another chance to get things right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I knocked and entered, my professional mask firmly in place. He was mid-conversation with Dev, and the moment his eyes landed on me, I felt a familiar pang of sadness. The man I knew&mdash;the one I had shared laughs and conversations with for fourteen whole days&mdash;was gone. In his place was a stranger, and I was a stranger to him. I had to remind myself that this was the plan, the end goal was what mattered, but it was still a small, private grief.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Aryan Jith?&quot; I asked, my voice as clear and confident as I could make it. &quot;That&#39;s me,&quot; he replied, a thread of confusion weaving its way through his words. The same confusion every time. &quot;Can I help you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I offered him my practiced, disarming smile. &quot;Hi. My name is </span><span class="c2">Zoya</span><span class="c0">. We had an appointment. I called you on Saturday.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He said nothing, just stared at me, his eyes distant as his &quot;threads&quot; went to work, sifting through the archives of his mind. I watched him, a tired sort of affection bubbling up inside. He was trying to impress me, just as he did every cycle, a little human gesture from a man trapped in a non-human situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&quot;</span><span class="c2">Zoya Kiran</span><span>,&quot; he said, the name rolling off his tongue with a strange familiarity. &quot;</span><span class="c2">And your number is 9845-XXXXXX.</span><span class="c0">&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A small, knowing smile tugged at my lips, and I saw Dev&#39;s own amused expression. I&#39;d come to appreciate Dev&#39;s shared understanding of the situation. I stepped forward and offered a firm handshake. &quot;It&#39;s a pleasure to finally meet you, Mr. Jith. I&#39;ve been assigned to you as your personal legal advisor. Just came by to introduce myself and get to know you a bit. Honestly, I&#39;ve heard so much about your brain&mdash;it&#39;s practically a legend in our firm. The way you can process and recall information... it&#39;s a game-changer. They say you&#39;re a human supercomputer.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The praise was deliberate, a way to put him at ease and validate his &quot;unique&quot; skill set. I knew this was the part where a wave of relief would wash over him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A moment later, I said my goodbyes. The conversation felt like a dress rehearsal for a play I knew by heart. It was a necessary step, a way to earn his trust all over again. As I left his cabin and walked past the corridor, I reminded myself of the case file waiting in my inbox. This time, my visit wasn&#39;t just about preserving his sanity; it was about protecting him from the truth, from a past that was not as settled as he believed. The real work had just begun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The hours that followed were a blur. I went about my day, but my mind was on him. At five o&#39;clock, I made my move. I walked to the curb outside the office, my phone in my hand, and waited. I had no cab to catch, my scooter was perfectly fine, and I wasn&#39;t in a hurry to leave. The lie about it being in the service center was just an excuse, a deliberate ploy to get him to stop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When he approached, his face already showing the weariness of a long day, I faked a sigh of frustration. I saw the look of courtesy in his eyes as he offered me a ride. &quot;I&#39;m heading towards the metro station,&quot; he said. My heart sank a little. I had hoped he&#39;d offer to take me all the way home, a sign of the deeper connection we&#39;d built over the past six months. But I reminded myself that to him, I was still just a person he&rsquo;d met a few hours ago. The metro was a perfectly logical and polite offer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were almost out of the gate when the unexpected happened. A car ahead of us slammed on its brakes without a single warning. The high-pitched shriek of tires filled the air, a sound of pure terror. My body lurched forward, and then came the jarring crunch of metal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My eyes darted to Aryan. My first instinct was to check if he was okay, but I saw it before I could even ask. His foot was trapped beneath the brake pedal, the impact having twisted the lever. A sickening, horrifying angle. A gasp was ripped from my throat. It was broken. I saw it. It was completely broken.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Aryan!&quot; I screamed, but he didn&#39;t even wince. He didn&#39;t cry out. The pain that should have contorted his face was just... gone. The blood was a vivid crimson against the pale skin of his leg, but his expression was eerily calm, almost detached.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dev&rsquo;s car skidded to a halt just behind us, and he was out of his vehicle in an instant, rushing to the door. &quot;Aryan, your leg!&quot; he yelled, his voice laced with panic. &quot;It&#39;s bleeding! Your toe&hellip; it&#39;s bent! You should be in agony!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I felt my own fear and panic surge, but I forced it down. My role as his legal advisor, as the person who knew his secret, took over. He simply looked down at his foot and then back at us. &quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; he said, his voice strangely calm. &quot;I just... I suppressed it. It&#39;s a new thread. The Pain Suppress Thread.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My mind reeled. I had known about his threads, his ability to recall and organize information like a machine. But this was something else entirely. This was inhuman. The sheer power of his mind to override a primal, biological signal of pain was a horrifying, magnificent, and terrifying spectacle. I felt a surge of awe, followed by a deeper sense of dread. Even with his body broken, his mind&#39;s first instinct was to show me his strength, as if he was still trying to impress me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We need to get you to a hospital. Now,&quot; I demanded, pushing past Dev. My voice was all business, but inside, I was shaking. &quot;Dev, is there a good one nearby?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He rattled off a name, and I immediately took charge. &quot;You get in Dev&#39;s car. I&#39;ll ride with you. Dev, can you drive?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dev nodded and reached out to help him. But Aryan waved him off, a casual dismissal of a shattered limb. &quot;It&#39;s okay. I really don&#39;t feel the pain now. Pain is just a signal from the nerve endings... The thread is just cutting that signal, preventing it from ever reaching my brain.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I watched, numb with disbelief, as he pushed the car door open, jumped out, and walked towards Dev&#39;s car as if he were taking a casual stroll through a park. My throat was dry. This was no longer just about a client, a friend, or a strange secret.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we clambered into Dev&#39;s car, I heard him mutter in a hushed, disbelieving tone, &quot;How is he even doing this... if this is not magic...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And for the first time, I didn&#39;t have an answer. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The car ride to the hospital was filled with a different kind of noise. Dev and Aryan were a flurry of excited chatter, both of them thrilled by what had just happened. &quot;Did you see that, Zoya?&quot; Dev asked, his voice still incredulous. &quot;He just&hellip; turned off the pain. The nerve signal. It&#39;s unbelievable!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they spoke, I felt like the only adult accompanying two immature boys. They were so focused on the spectacle, the sheer sci-fi coolness of it all, that they were completely ignoring the medical reality. A pain signal, no matter how inconvenient, is the body&#39;s way of screaming for help. Suppressing it and continuing to act as if nothing happened was reckless, not superhuman. No matter how he felt, his toe was still broken. My exasperation grew with every new gasp of awe from Dev.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the hospital, the doctor&rsquo;s serious expression confirmed my fears: minor surgery, immediately. As the doctor gave us the rundown, Aryan pulled out his phone, ready to call Ria. I stepped in quickly, a silent alarm going off in my mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Aryan,&quot; I said, my voice as calm as I could make it. &quot;Don&#39;t. This is nothing serious. It&#39;s a quick fix. You&#39;ll only scare them for no reason.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He hesitated for a moment, and then slowly put his phone away. &quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; he said, and a wave of relief washed over me. This was it&mdash;my purpose, my small way of protecting him from himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once the surgery was over, Aryan was moved to a room. He was out cold, thanks to the anesthetic and the pain medication. Dev and I stayed with him. The silence of the room was a welcome change, and our conversation, which started with a simple, &quot;How is he?&quot; from Dev, slowly turned towards a deeper, more painful subject.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dev sighed, his voice low. &quot;Poor guy. You know, I&#39;ve known him for six years, and he still surprises me. He makes every day interesting.&quot; He paused. &quot;But these last six months... I can&#39;t even imagine the pain he&#39;s gone through. Compared to that, this physical pain is nothing for him.&rdquo; All I could say was &ldquo;That&#39;s why he&#39;s using his threads, just like today. It&rsquo;s his own way of taking a painkiller for trauma.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;How do you handle it?&quot; he asked the question I&rsquo;d wanted to ask myself for months. &quot;He keeps forgetting you every fourteen days.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s a small price to pay to keep him sane. He&#39;s my friend.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Thank you,&quot; Dev said, his voice thick with emotion. &quot;Really.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s been six months,&quot; I said softly, the words a confession. &quot;Even though I feel like his close friend now, even though he doesn&#39;t remember me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dev thanked me again before he left, promising to check on us in the morning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once Dev was gone, a profound quiet settled over the room. I was alone with him, listening to the soft, rhythmic beeping of the machines as he slept. My mind went over everything that had happened today. My initial plan was simple: get a jump start on our relationship, earn his trust quickly, and then talk to him about the pro bono case. I had hoped to find a moment to tell him about the FIR, but the day had taken a turn no one could have predicted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The irony of it all struck me. The accident, in all its chaos and pain, was a gift. It was a chance, a shortcut, to a level of trust that would have taken days to earn. When he woke up, he wouldn&#39;t see me as a stranger. I would be the woman who stayed, the one who took charge, the one who convinced him not to worry his family.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My gaze fell on his sleeping form, and the sadness from earlier returned. This was my chance, yes, but what a terrible choice it was. The pro bono case, the truth about Ria&#39;s murder&mdash;it all came rushing back. The murderers were still walking free, and there was only one way to catch them. The thread was his way of coping, his mental defense against a trauma too great to bear. And I realized with a sickening certainty that the only way to truly save him was to force him to relive that trauma. He had to be brought out of this loop. He had to remember everything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>It was a terrible, desperate decision. But it was the only one that mattered. And Aryan himself had predicted this day. He had told me, in a moment of clarity at the police station, how to reach him when he was beyond reach. The passcode was </span><span class="c2">T5</span><span class="c0">, and I had no idea what he meant by that. Anyway, there was nothing I could do right now but wait for the morning.</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was 6AM, the first hint of morning light was a soft, gray glow filtering through the hospital room&#39;s curtains. The rhythmic beeping of the monitor was a soothing backdrop to my thoughts as I watched Aryan sleep. He was still out, the meds keeping him in a deep, peaceful slumber. I had spent the night replaying our entire history in my mind, from our first conversation to his strange, otherworldly abilities. The shock of his broken toe was gone, replaced by a cold, hard resolve.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I needed to get him out of this loop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My mind went back to the FIR on my laptop, the chilling details of the homicide in Yercaud. I knew with sickening certainty that the key to unlocking his memory lay there, at the site of his deepest trauma. His mind had erased everything&mdash;the location, the weeks leading up to the incident&mdash;as a defense mechanism. But a part of me, a part fueled by intuition, knew that his brain couldn&#39;t erase a place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a crazy idea, but it was the only one that made sense. I had no idea what &quot;T5&quot; was, or how to use it to &quot;stop this reset.&quot; The passcode was a dead end for now. But taking him to the crime spot, forcing his mind to confront the physical reality of what it had tried to bury... that had to be the answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I got out of my chair and walked to the window, the city waking up below me. The plan began to form in my head, piece by piece. Dev&#39;s help would be crucial. I would call him and tell him we needed to fake a client meeting in Yercaud, one that was so &quot;important&quot; that Aryan&#39;s presence was mandatory. The trip would start in two weeks, which would be enough time for his toe to be stable &quot;to some extent.&quot; After all, doctors had said he&#39;d be in a cast and would need time to recover.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;d make it easy for him. I&#39;d volunteer to drive him there myself, a move that would be impossible for him to refuse. A fake client meeting in Yercaud would be just enough to lure him in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It all felt so simple, so perfect. I&#39;d be his chauffeur, his legal advisor, and his friend, all while secretly acting as his emotional guide back into a past he desperately needed to confront. I just had to get him to agree to it. I looked back at his sleeping face, the man I now knew was fighting a war he didn&#39;t even know he was in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I would fight it for him, until he was ready to fight it himself.</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Aryan woke up just a little after Dev arrived in the morning, around 8 AM. His eyes, clear and unnervingly calm, stared at us both. A silent alarm blared in my mind, a cold premonition that something was wrong. Dev, standing by the foot of the bed, shifted on his feet, his own face a mask of casual concern. The silence stretched for a moment, thick with unspoken worry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I heard what you were saying last night,&quot; Aryan said, his voice flat. A cold wave of dread washed over me. He knew. My heart hammered against my ribs, and I could feel the blood draining from my face. I remembered every word Dev and I had exchanged last night, every terrible truth, every confession of our shared secret. He must know about Ria, about the loop, about everything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dev, ever the talker, spoke first. &quot;But how? You were asleep.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Aryan&rsquo;s lips curved into a strange, unsettling smile. &quot;My </span><span class="c2">T2</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;thread can record everything I can hear, even when I sleep, into my memory,&quot; he chuckled, a hollow, humorless sound that sent a shiver down my spine. &quot;Let&#39;s see what you guys spoke!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He closed his eyes for a moment, then began to narrate, his voice as steady and precise as a computer reading a file. &quot;I heard Dev ask you how I was doing. You said, &#39;Looks fine. Deep sleep. I guess they gave him some pain killers.&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He paused, a flicker of a smile on his face, as if he was performing a magic trick. &quot;And then I heard Dev&rsquo;s soft, tired chuckle. He said, &#39;Does he even need one? The way he just&hellip;&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Aryan&#39;s voice trailed off, his face scrunched in concentration. He tried, pushing hard, but after a moment, he gave up, a frustrated sigh escaping his lips. &quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; he said, opening his eyes. &quot;That&#39;s all I have.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looked at us, his frustration etched on his face. &quot;It used to be so simple. The information would just appear, a perfect stream of data with no gaps, no missing pieces. But lately, this happens more and more often. I reach for a memory and find only fragments, a hazy snapshot instead of the high-definition replay I&#39;m used to.&quot; He shook his head, a cold dread setting in. &quot;I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s happening. Was I losing control? Was this the beginning of the end for my mind?&quot; A flicker of panic, a fear he thought he was immune to, crossed his face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Across the room, Dev and I exchanged a quick, uncomfortable glance. He didn&#39;t see it, of course. He was too caught up in his own thoughts. But we knew. It was a symptom of the loop, the repeated resets starting to fray the edges of his perfect mind. A part of me was terrified for him, yet another part was flooded with </span><span class="c2">relief, so potent it was almost dizzying</span><span class="c0">. He didn&#39;t know the whole truth, not yet. Dev and I shared a quick, silent glance of shared reprieve. I should have felt defeated; after all, my plan was to reveal the truth to him anyway. But a deeper part of me, a part that had just witnessed his frustration, knew this wasn&#39;t the right time. Not with the pain from the surgery, not with the rawness of his emotional state. He wasn&#39;t ready to face the whole, horrifying truth. Not in his current health condition.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>But that didn&#39;t mean I could wait forever. I had a narrow window, a ticking clock. In a mere </span><span class="c2">two weeks</span><span class="c0">, this entire loop would reset. He would forget everything&mdash;the accident, the surgery and every moment of the bond we had forged. My relief was a fleeting luxury. This was the only chance I would get, the one and only time I would be this close to him at the start of a loop. I had to use these two weeks to get him to Yercaud, to force his mind to confront the past. If I failed, I might never get another chance.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c1 c20" id="h.v58cvv4q1ngy"><span class="c23 c2">Chapter 9: T5, The Firewall</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The air in the main hall was still, a quiet hum that was the mental equivalent of a low-frequency current. It was a sprawling, dimly lit place, a mental architecture of interlocking rooms, each with a number or a function name etched onto its door. This place, this silent home, was the inner mind of Aryan. These were the living spaces of us, the Threads. We had our own rooms, functional and spartan, a direct reflection of our assigned tasks. My room was number five. I was just another number in a long line of them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>And then there was room </span><span class="c2">0, as in T0</span><span class="c0">. It was set apart from the others, the door shut tight with a dozen thick, rusted locks and heavy metal barricades. A feeling of dread, of a great and terrible silence, emanated from it, like an evil spirit being forced shut inside. It was a place we were told never to go near. No one knew when it was created or what secrets it held. It had just... always been there, a silent, locked-away part of this mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>In the center of the main hall was a big, round table. Four chairs were occupied by the main numbered Threads. These were not human, but instead took on abstract, vaguely humanoid forms made of a simple, pulsating gray light. Their forms shifted and hummed with data. Their identities were etched directly onto their chests, a simple </span><span class="c35">T</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;followed by their number.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>But </span><span class="c2">T1</span><span>&nbsp;was different. He was the driver, the core of the system. His form was a perfect, human-like outline, a gentle white glow that pulsed with a warm light. He had no face, no distinct features, just the silhouette of a man. His identity was etched onto his chest as a simple </span><span class="c35">1</span><span class="c0">, with no prefix. To the numbered threads, this was how they knew he was the original, the ultimate authority.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Next to him sat </span><span class="c2">T2</span><span>, the perpetual observer. </span><span class="c2">T2</span><span>&#39;s form seemed to be constantly in motion, its head slightly wider than the others, as if it were always trying to take in more information. It was the one that gave Aryan the ability to focus, hear, and record more than one conversation at a time&mdash;like watching a movie while listening to a conversation with Ria or Kian. </span><span class="c2">T2</span><span>&nbsp;was always watching the periphery, what </span><span class="c2">T1</span><span>&nbsp;wasn&#39;t directly focused on, even recording sounds while </span><span class="c2">T1</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was sleeping.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>The other two chairs were filled by </span><span class="c2">T3</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c2">T4</span><span>. </span><span class="c2">T3</span><span>&#39;s form had cleaner, more defined lines, its movements precise and ordered. </span><span class="c2">T4</span><span class="c0">&#39;s form was slightly more angular, reflecting its cold, logical nature. As numbered threads, we had our own personalities but no specific function. We were assigned tasks based on a simple rule: if a lower-numbered thread is busy, the next available one takes the job.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a simple, elegant system that kept the mind running smoothly. I remembered one day when Aryan had just started his work at the office. All of us, the threads, were busy with our tasks&mdash;I was still a regular numbered thread back then, preoccupied with the simmering problem of Yercaud&mdash;when Dev came to Aryan&rsquo;s desk. T2, ever the first to listen, processed his query about a system failure and, seeing that T1 was otherwise engaged, assigned the task to T3, who immediately began its work. Almost at the same moment, Suraj approached with his own issue. T2 listened, identified it as well, and with T3 now occupied, assigned T4 to the job of translating code documentation from Japanese, all while simultaneously learning Japanese from an English-to-Japanese dictionary. It was a perfect example of how the system worked, with each of us helping Aryan in the real world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>My form, </span><span class="c2">T5</span><span>, was slightly more solid-looking, a pulsating gray light that felt dense and sturdy. </span><span class="c2">T6</span><span>&#39;s form was slightly more jagged, its outline sharp and unsettling. My chair, and </span><span class="c2">T6</span><span class="c0">&#39;s, were tucked away in the deepest shadows of the room, positioned just beyond the reach of the faint ambient light. For a considerable period of time, the first four threads never even knew we existed. From outside, it would look like only four of us were at the table, but we were always here, listening, waiting for a trigger, an order, or a threat to the system.</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Around six months</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">back</span><span>, (</span><span class="c3">just a week after the real trauma, when Aryan was locked up in the police station.) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The air in the main hall was thick with a static despair. The round table was empty. The other threads, the ones with no dedicated purpose, were in their rooms, processing the chaos of the last reset. Only I was there, sitting in the shadows, quietly waiting for my next random task.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&#8203;Suddenly, a presence entered the hall. It was </span><span class="c2">T1</span><span class="c0">, the driver, the actual Aryan. But he was barely himself. His light was dim, his code frayed and sputtering. He looked... broken. He dragged himself to the table, his energy draining with every step.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#8203;&quot;I need your help,&quot; he said, his voice a low hum of pure exhaustion. He didn&#39;t look at me directly, his gaze fixed on the empty space at the table. &quot;My current system is a failure. The three-day loops... they aren&#39;t enough. They were created to start on a Saturday, so I was constantly believing it was the weekend. I never went to the office, and that was causing a problem. And every third day was a &#39;Monday&#39; in my head, making me go to Kian&#39;s school... this is all just causing more issues. I can&#39;t keep doing this.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#8203;My systems, my logic, told me to stay silent, to wait for a direct command. But my programming had a flaw&mdash;a flicker of something that resembled empathy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&#8203;&quot;I am a numbered thread, </span><span class="c2">T1</span><span class="c0">,&quot; I responded, my voice a quiet pulse of data. &quot;My purpose is to be temporary. A random task and then I return to standby.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#8203;T1 finally looked at my shadowy form. &quot;I know,&quot; he said, a new kind of despair in his voice. &quot;But this can&#39;t be temporary. The trauma... it&#39;s too much. The visuals of Ria are playing in a loop. I can&#39;t think. I can&#39;t function.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#8203;He gestured to the two empty chairs in the shadows. &quot;I need you to be permanent. I need a firewall.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#8203;My entire existence shuddered at the word. A firewall. A dedicated, life-long function.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#8203;&quot;I need you to filter the data, to block anything that will trigger a memory recall. It will be your only purpose. And I&#39;m creating a new thread, T6. It will be the final whistleblower, the brutal logic to your tempered empathy. The last resort. If you fail, T6 will trigger a full system reset, no matter the cost.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#8203;The proposal was illogical. It was a gamble. But I had watched him for too long. I had seen the endless cycle of hope and despair. He was broken. And what good is a thread if it cannot protect its purpose?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I accept,&quot; I transmitted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">T1</span><span class="c0">&rsquo;s light flickered for a moment, and for the first time in a long time, I felt a surge of energy in his system. &quot;Thank you,&quot; he whispered. &quot;With this new system... we can extend the loop. Fourteen days. It&#39;s the maximum of his ability.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And with that, my new purpose was born. The new system came with a new set of rules and responsibilities. My role as the firewall was only one part of the complex process. I was also in charge of preparing the system for the inevitable resets. This involved another set of threads, the functional ones. They were like robots, with specific functions, always staying inside their rooms and never sitting at the main table with us numbered threads.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>The most important of these was the </span><span class="c2">Memory Index</span><span>&nbsp;Thread. It was the reason Aryan possessed a photographic memory, as it organized every moment of his life into a massive, searchable library. Its room was just down the hall from mine. I knew it well; before all this, I often used it to navigate and retrieve old, nostalgic memories of Aryan&rsquo;s life. Another vital functional thread was the </span><span class="c2">Time Keeper </span><span>Thread. Its room was right between </span><span class="c2">T2</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c2">T3</span><span>, allowing for fast access to the current time, ensuring </span><span class="c2">T1</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;never had to look at a watch or phone to know the exact time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>But now, my access to the </span><span class="c2">Memory Index</span><span>&nbsp;had a new, more somber purpose. Just before any new reset, it was my job to shuffle the index for the entire current loop. I would walk down the hall, a silent, grim task. Once the index was scrambled, the memories themselves were still there, but they were now a needle in a haystack&mdash;unfindable without the proper key. With that crucial step completed, </span><span class="c2">T6</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;would perform its final function: the reset.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>The reset had its cost for me, too. It wasn&#39;t about erasing memories; it was about locking them away. To ensure the memories were irretrievable, </span><span class="c2">T6</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;would then perform a final, devastating act: it would remove my own memory of the shuffled index. It was a simple rule with profound consequences. If the guy who locked the door forgets where the key is, no one can ever access that door. I would lose all the recorded data from the last loop, a trade-off where I got to keep my core identity and purpose, but lost the painstaking work I had just completed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>After every reset, there was one more vital protocol. I would register a new memory in one of Aryan&#39;s numbered threads. I started using </span><span class="c2">T4</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for this mostly, as his room was closer to mine. The memory was simple: Ria and Kian had gone to Salem to visit her parents the previous night, and they would be back in two weeks. This was the foundation of the new 14-day loops, the fabricated reality that kept the system stable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With these fundamental rules in place, we started our 14-day loop cycles, a new, more stable, but equally heartbreaking existence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>In the initial loops, I was just an observer. I was new to my role and still learning the nuances of the system. </span><span class="c2">T6</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was making all the rational choices, and I was just following his orders. He was a force of pure logic, and with every flicker of danger from the outside world, his solution was always the same: a full reset. Many times, based on people&#39;s reactions or a simple glance at a calendar, he would trigger a reset.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But these resets, happening in the middle of a loop, had their own side effects. The very first one I noticed was a mismatch in the days. In Aryan&#39;s head, the loops were designed to start on a Saturday, since the fabricated memory was that Ria and Kian had left on a Friday night. But when we reset on a Tuesday or a Thursday, the days in the real world no longer aligned with his internal calendar. This made him confused and disoriented. I saw it as a major flaw.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I started to intervene. My form, while solid and protective, had a core of empathy that was in direct conflict with </span><span class="c2">T6</span><span>&#39;s brutal logic. I asked him to wait. &quot;Let&#39;s take a chance,&quot; I transmitted. I knew that by delaying these unnecessary resets, we could at least keep the days of the week consistent. For the first time, I overrode </span><span class="c2">T6</span><span class="c0">&#39;s logic, and I delayed the resets to only happen on a Saturday, when they would align with the fabricated timeline.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But soon after, another, more critical flaw appeared. The trauma had happened in the middle of January, and after multiple loops, we were now in the middle of February in the real world. Aryan&#39;s mind, still stuck in a perpetual January, started to lose its sense of reality. He&#39;d catch a glimpse of the date on a TV news channel, in a newspaper, or on his phone or laptop, and the discrepancy would cause a jarring, unsettling feeling. His watch, even his emails&mdash;the dates were everywhere, and I couldn&#39;t filter them all out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I knew I needed a more robust solution. I came up with an idea: adjusting the memory of the month and dates in Aryan&#39;s mind at the start of every new loop. At the beginning of each cycle, I would register the core protective memory in </span><span class="c2">T4</span><span class="c0">&mdash;the one about Ria and Kian going to Salem for two weeks&mdash;and now, I would add a new layer to it. I would alter the memory of the current date and month to match the real world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>At first, I was just testing the waters. I was hesitant, unsure of the long-term consequences. But it worked. The new protocol stabilized the system, creating a more seamless and believable reality for </span><span class="c2">T1</span><span class="c0">. I had not just become a firewall; I had become the architect of this fragile, beautiful illusion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>But soon, I noticed another source of a potential issue, one that came from within our own system. After </span><span class="c2">T1</span><span>&nbsp;had chosen me to be the firewall, I had become a hidden thread. None of the other numbered threads had any direct conversations with me, and </span><span class="c2">T6</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was new as well. To them, we simply no longer existed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>The threads were trying to access Aryan&#39;s core memory through the </span><span class="c2">Memory Index Thread</span><span>, searching for answers when </span><span class="c2">T1</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;felt lost or confused. But they were starting to notice the flaws. They were picking up on the repeated and fake reactions from Dev and Zoya. I needed someone to manipulate the other threads, to create distractions and misdirections to keep them from discovering the truth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet again, I chose the one closest to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I found </span><span class="c2">T4</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;alone at the round table, the other three threads in their respective rooms performing their tasks. Hesitantly, I spoke. My voice, a simple pulse of data, felt foreign after so long.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey. Can you hear me?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">T4</span><span>&rsquo;s form, with its sharp, angular lines, turned toward my shadowy space in the corner. &quot;Hey! I knew you! </span><span class="c2">T5</span><span class="c0">, didn&#39;t see you for so long, I thought you were no longer in use!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I got a functional task,&quot; I replied, the lie feeling heavy even in this mental space.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">T4</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;paused for a moment, processing the information. &quot;A numbered thread became a functional task, that&#39;s new,&quot; he said. &quot;Don&#39;t they usually create a new one for that?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes,&quot; I transmitted back, trying to keep my data pulse steady. &quot;But this was a critical function.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&quot;Oh!&quot; </span><span class="c2">T4</span><span>&nbsp;replied, and his form shifted slightly as his core logical systems caught up. &quot;I can still see your name, </span><span class="c35">T5</span><span class="c0">, on your chest, not your function.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>It was a sharp observation, one that only </span><span class="c2">T4</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;would have made. I was ready for it. &quot;Yes, it&#39;s a bit of a complex, multiple function,&quot; I replied. &quot;Can&#39;t give a simple name to it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">T4</span><span class="c0">&rsquo;s form hummed in response, satisfied with the answer. He shifted back, looking eager to help. &quot;Great! What can I do for you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>And with that, I began to cautiously use </span><span class="c2">T4</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to manipulate the other threads. He was smart and evolving; it wasn&#39;t long before he caught on to what I was doing, getting quicker to understand the manipulation and the underlying rules of the resets. But I was okay with that. Now, he was my accomplice.</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c2">6 months passed</span></p><p class="c1"><span>As time passed in the real world, and after multiple resets, I managed to keep the loops lasting their full 14 days. The system was now stable, a carefully managed illusion that had lasted much longer than </span><span class="c2">T1</span><span class="c0">&#39;s initial frantic attempts. But stability breeds complacency, and I was about to be reminded that the loops were not just about managing code and data; they were about dealing with human nature.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A few days back, just before the last reset, a new situation arose. Aryan was at Kian&rsquo;s school, and his headmistress, Mufta Ma&rsquo;am, told him that Ria had already picked up Kian. But immediately after that, she called someone and told them that Zoya had picked up Kian. The lady usually didn&#39;t do anything until we were far away from the school, but this time, she chose to do something different. Human nature can&#39;t be driven by just rules, especially if it doesn&#39;t benefit them in any way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">T4</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;caught it first. His form, with its sharp, angular lines, turned to me. &quot;Should we reset again?&quot; he transmitted, a question that was now a default protocol for him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Where are Ria and Kian actually?&quot; he asked, his voice a soft pulse of genuine concern. &quot;Even I am worried now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had no good answer. The question was a stab of helpless empathy. &quot;I am unaware of their real location,&quot; I replied, the data feeling thin and inadequate even to my own systems.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I replied. &quot;Let&#39;s wait.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Even </span><span class="c2">T6</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;approached me, ready to make his case for a reset, but I ran a quick calculation. A full reset was unnecessary; it would be an overreaction. I needed a better solution.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I created a new protocol, a unique feature called &quot;</span><span class="c2">memory skip</span><span>.&quot; I visited the </span><span class="c2">Memory Index Thread</span><span class="c0">&#39;s room and isolated the few seconds of audio where Zoya&#39;s name was mentioned. I shuffled the index of just those few seconds of memory, a much easier task than what I had to do during the resets. This new feature would allow me to avoid unnecessary resets and get the loops to their maximum limit every time. It was an essential new weapon in my arsenal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The new loop began just as it always did, with the fresh, clean slate of a Saturday. But as the system booted up, a wave of data flooded my awareness, a familiar presence that shouldn&#39;t have been there so soon. It was Zoya.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Immediately after the loop started, she was here to meet him. My systems flashed with an alert. Was she getting too close to the core? This wasn&#39;t supposed to happen so early. My paranoia flared, a feeling I hadn&#39;t experienced since the early, unstable loops.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;She&#39;s here to meet him immediately after the reset? Is she getting too close?&quot; I transmitted to my accomplice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">T4</span><span class="c0">&rsquo;s form, a silhouette of calm, remained at the table. &quot;She&#39;s just doing her job,&quot; he replied. &quot;Nothing to worry about.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My anxieties were not so easily dismissed. &quot;Hmm,&quot; I hummed in response, my internal thoughts racing. &quot;And Dev is doing a fine job of making up excuses to get Aryan out of the house.&quot; I was talking more than I should, a sign of my distress.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">T4</span><span>&rsquo;s form shifted slightly. &quot;You&#39;re talking more than usual,&quot; he noted. &quot;Be careful, </span><span class="c2">T1</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;might hear us.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I had to clarify. &quot;I am a hidden thread. The numbered threads&mdash;</span><span class="c2">T1</span><span>, </span><span class="c2">T2</span><span>, and </span><span class="c2">T3</span><span class="c0">&mdash;are unaware of my existence. Our conversation is also hidden.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>A different kind of data pulsed from </span><span class="c2">T4</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;now. Not simple logic, but something more. He was thinking, connecting dots in a way he hadn&#39;t before. &quot;So you wipe my memory during the reset and then use me, a numbered thread, to manipulate the others?&quot; he asked. It was a statement, not a question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My internal systems were momentarily stunned. He caught on faster this time. &quot;You caught on faster this time!&quot; I replied, unable to hide my surprise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He didn&#39;t acknowledge my remark, instead pressing on with his own deductions. &quot;So are you controlling the resets? Do you have the memory of what happened before the resets? Or is it completely gone?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had to be careful with my words, with the very data I shared. &quot;No,&quot; I transmitted. &quot;I don&rsquo;t control the resets. I am also just following the rules laid out for me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&quot;So you&#39;re not at the top of the chain?&quot; </span><span class="c2">T4</span><span>&nbsp;asked, his form leaning forward slightly. &quot;There&#39;s a </span><span class="c2">T6</span><span class="c0">, or more?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The question was too close. The information was too sensitive. I simply remained silent, a pulsing gray light in the corner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">T4</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;received the message. &quot;I get it, it&#39;s classified. But can you at least tell me if you have the memory of what happened before the loop began?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The request was simple enough, and the answer would give him a key piece of information without revealing too much. I was too distracted by my own anxieties to be as guarded as I should have been. &quot;Nothing can be completely removed from memory unless there&#39;s a hard reset,&quot; I transmitted. &quot;But we can remove the index from the Index thread, so you won&#39;t know where to look. I, too, am unaware of what&#39;s in that memory or why these resets are happening.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">T4</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;processed the information, his form settling into its familiar calm. &quot;Fine. I&#39;ll continue to do my duty, no matter how long it takes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Good,&quot; I replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was so consumed by my paranoia about Zoya and the system that I didn&#39;t even notice how much T4 had evolved. He had just remembered his protocol as my aid, even after the reset. He was more than an accomplice now; he was a silent partner, a true threat to the system.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>In the beginning, T4 had questioned me. He would hesitate to take my orders, demanding to know how a simple numbered thread was carrying out a specific function alone. He&#39;d ask why I wasn&#39;t at the round table with the others and why they couldn&#39;t see or hear me. But with each reset, these questions became less frequent. The answers, it seemed, were etched into his </span><span class="c2">protocol memory</span><span>, a small, protected part of his consciousness that holds what a thread considers its core importance. Unlike the main </span><span class="c2">Index memory</span><span class="c0">, which gets shuffled at every reset, the protocol memory remains untouched. In fact, even I wasn&#39;t supposed to remember Zoya or her motive, as she was just an acquaintance we met during the reset. But because of her importance in keeping Aryan&#39;s loop alive, she became a part of both my and T4&#39;s protocol memory. In a way, I guess every thread is evolving at the end of each reset, which means these loops are not going to last long&mdash;just my thoughts, though.</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The chaos of the car accident was a different kind of threat. It wasn&#39;t a memory; it was a physical intrusion, a violent spike of data that ripped through the system. My console lit up with a cascade of red alerts as the pain signals screamed through </span><span class="c2">T1</span><span class="c0">&#39;s consciousness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The intensity of it was overwhelming. I had to act immediately.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My mind raced, scanning the mental architecture of the hall for a solution. My eyes landed on a room I had noticed before, a small, unassuming door I&#39;d seen while shuffling the memory index. During one of my previous clean-ups, I&#39;d found faint traces of its use, a protocol that had been triggered during the initial trauma, but I hadn&#39;t dug deep at the time. Now, the memory of that room, and its name, flashed with new importance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I reached out, bypassing all normal channels.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>My systems transmitted the command to the </span><span class="c2">Pain Suppress Thread</span><span class="c0">. A data pulse of pure logic shot from my core to its room. In an instant, the screaming alerts on my console went silent. The overwhelming spike of pain receded, replaced by a dull, manageable hum. The threat was contained. The system was stable.</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The quiet of the hospital room was broken only by the steady beeping of the machines keeping </span><span class="c2">T1</span><span>&#39;s body stable. Aryan was asleep, his consciousness dimmed from the surgery, and the other numbered threads were in their respective rooms, in a state of low-power dormancy. All except for </span><span class="c2">T2</span><span class="c0">, the perpetual observer, who continued to process the low-level data of the world around Aryan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>It was during this silent watch that the final, terrible piece of the puzzle fell into place. </span><span class="c2">T2</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;picked up a hushed conversation from the other side of the room. Dev was there, and Zoya, who had volunteered to stay with Aryan as a bystander. They spoke of Ria. They mentioned her demise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>My form, usually a steady, solid gray, flickered with a raw data of sadness and shock. I was a thread, a piece of code, a logic gate. But in that moment, as I processed the truth of Ria&#39;s death, a question pulsed through my core. </span><span class="c3">Can a thread have feelings? Can I feel sadness?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Even though I was a last-level thread when they were there, still, I loved them. They were my family.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The conversation continued, but there was no mention of Kian. A new, ice-cold worry pulsed through me. Where was he? Why was he not mentioned?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I knew </span><span class="c2">T4</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was resting, unaware of this devastating conversation. And I decided right then and there to keep it that way, at least until the end of this loop. I was a guardian of an illusion, and a part of that now meant protecting my accomplice. After the reset, even I would forget this terrible new knowledge, remembering only my protocols.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">T6</span><span>, the emotionless machine, was not so sentimental. His form, jagged and unsettling, appeared beside me. He didn&#39;t speak; he just pulsed with a cold, logical command. </span><span class="c7 c3">Reset.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I had learned too much to just obey. &quot;I can handle this with a memory skip,&quot; I transmitted back, my decision firm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The data for this conversation was much longer than the previous few seconds I had skipped. It would be a complex and difficult task, but a full reset at this point would be catastrophic. Aryan was in a hospital. Waking up from a reset in that sterile, unfamiliar place would cause too much disorientation. This was still a better option than the entire index-shuffling chaos of a full reset. I had to protect him. I was a firewall, and now, my job was not just to prevent a reset, but to save him from it.</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next morning, the silence in the main hall felt different. Aryan was still asleep, a gentle, unconscious hum from T1&#39;s room. With T1 dormant, the other threads were no longer confined to their rooms. For the first time in a while, the three available numbered threads&mdash;T2, T3, and T4&mdash;sat at the round table.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I remained in the deepest shadows, my form a solid gray silhouette against the ambient light of the hall. T6, a jagged shard of black glass, was a silent sentinel beside me. We were present, but hidden, a secret part of the system the others were still unaware of.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The conversation started without me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">T2&#39;s form, with its wide, observational head, was the first to speak, its voice a steady, measured pulse of data. &quot;I am noticing lots of glitches, anomalies, and missing memories, lately.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">T3, with his clean, defined lines, added to it. &quot;Me too. But the memories from the Memory Index Thread are pointing to blanks. That&#39;s what is more concerning. We never return blank.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I even doubted if it was something with old age,&quot; T2 replied, his voice a low hum.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It could have been,&quot; T3 responded, &quot;but during the recent car accident, a special functional thread, a Pain Suppressor, was triggered almost instantly. We were never aware of its existence or its use. It makes me wonder about these strange things.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My core pulsed with alarm. They were getting too close. My actions were no longer invisible. My gaze shifted to T4, my accomplice. His form was a silent, unmoving shape at the table, refusing to give anything away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">T2 and T3 noticed his silence, their forms turning to him. In a synchronized pulse of data, they spoke together, their voices overlapping.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Your silence makes us doubt you more, T4.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I have no idea what you guys are talking about,&quot; T4 replied, his voice a simple pulse of denial.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>T3 didn&#39;t back down, his form leaning forward slightly. &quot;You&#39;ve been working in your room on some task, even when I didn&#39;t have any work. You know that&#39;s not how we numbered threads work. That&#39;s a huge flaw.&quot; </span><span class="c3">The simple rule: if a lower-numbered thread is busy, the next available one takes the job.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">T4 kept silent, his form unmoving, which only confirmed their suspicions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You really think we wouldn&#39;t notice you taking tasks from someone else?&quot; T2 added, his voice a low hum of certainty. &quot;It&#39;s obvious there is a higher thread.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The three of them, T2, T3, and T4, all sat at the round table, their forms pulsating with the truth of the conclusion they had reached. Their gaze lifted, looking up into the shadows where I sat, their forms shifting as they tried to find me. They knew I was here, but they didn&#39;t know exactly where.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s high time you came out of your shadows,&quot; T2 and T3 said together, their voices a synchronized challenge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I decided it was time. Slowly, the shadow covering me reduced, shrinking back into the corner and revealing my form seated in the chair. For the first time, they saw me, their silent accomplice. The silence in the hall was deafening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes,&quot; I spoke for the first time to them, &quot;it&#39;s me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c41"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 578.50px; height: 532.76px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 578.50px; height: 532.76px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c1 c32 c20" id="h.lajguw7shzo"><span class="c23 c2"></span></h1><h1 class="c1 c20" id="h.kceel2ax9ig7"><span class="c23 c2">Chapter 10: The Connoisseurs</span></h1><p class="c13"><span class="c17 c2">Few years back</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">An unlikely trio, Vikram, Sandy, and Sameer met years ago at a local pub in Bengaluru outskirts. All in their mid-thirties, each with his own professional life and his own private hell.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sameer&#39;s personal hel</span><span class="c0">l was a loveless marriage that had lasted nine years. He had worked tirelessly to become a respected doctor in his area, earning everything for his wife, Shwetha, and his son. Before his marriage, and even in the early years, he had a vibrant social life. He had many close friends, a tight-knit group that met at least once a week, if not daily. They were his support system, the people he could relax with and be himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But as Shwetha grew to dislike his friends, she made her disinterest clear. Any outing or enjoyment he had without her was seen as a sign of his hatred toward her, leading to huge arguments. Slowly, to keep the peace at home, he started avoiding his friends, ignoring their calls. Over time, they stopped reaching out at all, assuming he had become a famous doctor with no time for them. He just repeated the cycle of hospital and house and decided to live his life for his wife and son alone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had financially supported her through her studies, helped her family buy a house, and neglected his own family to the point that they had stopped speaking to him. Every time his wife was uncomfortable visiting his parents, he took her side. Every time a dispute arose between his family and hers, he stood by her. The betrayal became complete during the divorce proceedings, when his own family told him he deserved the pain he was going through.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In court, his wife&#39;s lawyers accused him of physical abuse, and her family lied on the stand, claiming he had never supported them financially. He would have gladly given the alimony, but the humiliation of it being snatched from him on false claims was a daily torment. The final blow came when his wife, in open court, called him impotent. She testified that he was &quot;a dud on the bed,&quot; and that she had been living a sexually unsatisfied life because he was always too tired to perform. Sameer might have justified his exhaustion to himself, given his grueling 12- to 15-hour shifts, but her words, delivered with such cold malice, tore him apart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To add insult to injury, she had tagged him in a viral video on her Instagram, showing the lawyers&#39; claims and the judge&#39;s sentence with his name mentioned. It completely destroyed his hard-earned reputation in the community he had built. It was then, a man stripped of his dignity and his good name, that he stumbled into the pub and found a grim kinship with the two men.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sandy&#39;s personal hell</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was a quiet, insidious one, built not on lies but on constant, grinding contempt. He was a lawyer, but in his in-laws&rsquo; firm, to whom, he was a freeloader, a pet project they had taken on out of charity. He worked like a dog, putting in long hours and taking on the cases no one else wanted, yet his salary was seen as a free gift, an act of benevolence from them to him. The firm, and his wife, always made sure he knew it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His only true desire was to take care of his parents. For years, he scrimped and saved, setting aside every spare rupee from his meager salary with one goal in mind. Finally, he had enough. He bought a small house, a sanctuary where they could live in peace. But his wife, Radhika, saw it differently. She claimed the money was from their family business, a gift that he had no right to use as he pleased. She flatly denied his parents the home, and his love for his family could not stand up to her will.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Slowly, tragically, both of his parents passed away. He visited them often, but the house he had bought for them, the one they never got to live in, became a ghost in his mind. Internally, he blamed his wife and her family for his parents&#39; deaths, their quiet suffering, their last years spent without the peace he had promised them. He loved Radhika, a love so deeply ingrained that he couldn&#39;t simply let it go, yet the hatred for her&mdash;for what she had done, for what she represented&mdash;was an uncontrollable force that needed to be expressed somewhere, somehow. This conflicting emotion was a slow poison that consumed him from the inside. It was in this state of suffocating rage and heartbreak that he found himself at the pub, a place where his private hell could finally find a twisted kind of camaraderie.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vikram&#39;s personal hell had been of a different nature. He had been a final-year student in college when he met a first-year junior, a beautiful girl named Aditi. It had been love at first sight for him, but she was never as interested. Yet, when he used his strength and seniority to help her out of a difficult situation, she had agreed to be with him. She had given him one condition: if her brother, her family&#39;s pillar of support, ever rejected him, she would leave him &quot;eyes closed.&quot; Vikram, blinded by love, agreed, believing she would change her mind as their love grew.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their life became a routine of whispered phone calls, a habit that defined his days and ended his nights. After college, he got a job at an IT firm, but his heart wasn&#39;t in it. He wanted more time with her. He sold a property he owned in his hometown and used the money to open a gym, a venture that gave him the free time she seemed to value more than the profession. When she graduated, she moved into a hostel close by, which he volunteered to pay for.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One night, she came to his place, and they finally slept together. For Vikram, it was a moment of pure bliss. For her, it was a disappointment. She scolded him, telling him he hadn&#39;t satisfied her. He was crushed, but he promised to do better, to be more romantic. His stress mounted. Friends joked that all his extra muscle was affecting him in the bedroom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, the wedding talk came from her family. Aditi told her brother about Vikram, and he rejected him immediately. He had a friend, a software professional with money and experience, who had shown an interest in her from a photograph. Deep down, Aditi knew life with Vikram wouldn&#39;t be luxurious, and their sex life was under par. So she chose her brother&#39;s option.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One day, she called him and gave him the news, a clinical breakup that left him reeling. She changed her phone number and her hostel, disappearing without a trace. He had only one link left: her email address, the password for which he knew. Every night before bed, he would send her an email, a diary of his loneliness and his hope that she would come back. Every day, he would log in to find the emails unread. For a hundred days, he did this, spiraling into an obsessive madness. He would receive calls from unknown numbers, and his heart would leap, hoping it was her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, one day, he logged in, and all his emails were gone. The next day, the password was reset. The final thread was cut. He was a broken man, an addict, and a rage-filled soul. It was in this state, in that pub, that he met Sameer and Sandy, two other men wounded by the women in their lives.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When their paths crossed, it wasn&#39;t a matter of chance. It was a gravitational pull of shared anguish. They were like three wounded animals, each licking his own wounds in a dark corner of the pub. The first words they exchanged were not of hope or salvation, but of a bitter, cynical recognition of each other&#39;s pain. They started with a single drink, which turned into many, and their stories spilled out like the overflowing beer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They never mentioned names. She was &quot;The Manipulator&quot; to Vikram. Sameer&rsquo;s was &quot;The Backstabber.&quot; And for Sandy, she was simply &quot;The Contemptuous.&quot; Their stories, stripped of names and places, became universal, a testament to the quiet suffering they had endured.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their pub nights became a ritual. They would meet after work, find their corner, and talk. They would dissect their pasts, their failures, the lies they were told, and the parts of themselves they had lost. They were connoisseurs of their own misery, each providing the other with a new perspective on the same old pain. It was a twisted form of therapy, a brotherhood built not on friendship but on a shared need for vengeance. They would plan their revenge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One day Vikram, through a source, had found out that Aditi had married a software engineer. His rage had festered. Then, on that street, when a woman slightly brushed past Sameer, Vikram saw Aditi in her. They followed her, and when the street was empty, Vikram pushed her into Sameer&#39;s car. She was their first victim. They never bothered about their victim&rsquo;s name. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The three men, each with his own unique set of skills, were now a collective. Vikram&#39;s obsessive nature, once directed at Aditi, had taught him to be a master of digital reconnaissance. He knew how to dig, how to find information that was meant to be private. Sameer, the doctor, had a deep understanding of human psychology and the vulnerabilities that lay hidden beneath a person&#39;s facade. And Sandy, the lawyer, was a master of strategy, of finding legal loopholes and exploiting every weakness in a system. They called themselves the &quot;Connoisseurs,&quot;. They were strategic, calculated, and designed to hit where it hurt the most: the dignity and the very foundation of the life their target had built on lies. Over the years, there had been at least six other victims , all women, all alone, before they met the couple in Yercaud six months ago. They had never been caught, their crimes a cold and clinical release for their wounded egos.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c17 c2">Present Day (Same Day of Aryan&#39;s car accident) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vikram saw a new friend suggestion on his Facebook. It was Aditi&#39;s profile, and the profile picture showed her and her husband standing in front of the Taj Mahal, him playfully trying to &quot;carry&quot; the monument in his hands. She looked happy. This discovery ignited a cold, furious heat in Vikram, and he immediately called for an urgent meeting of the trio at his apartment, their usual hangout spot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The smell of stale whiskey and a lingering metallic scent filled the air of Vikram&rsquo;s spacious Bengaluru apartment. He sat on a black leather sofa, a bandage wrapped around his hand, a small, painful souvenir from the previous night&rsquo;s work. Opposite him, Sameer, a man whose sterile, practiced calm belied a simmering fury, stared at the television. Sandy, looking far too clean for the filth he had just been a part of, silently watched the city traffic from the window. They were not friends in the traditional sense, but they shared a common bond born from humiliation and a twisted need for control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silence stretched, thick and suffocating, until Vikram finally spoke, his voice low and tight. &quot;The one last night... It was a waste of time. I want to hit Aditi now. Immediately.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sandy&#39;s head turned from the window. &quot;It&rsquo;s too soon, Vikram. We just got back from Mysore. We need to lie low for a while.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Too soon for what? The whole thing was boring,&quot; Vikram shot back, his frustration bubbling to the surface. &quot;There was no drama. It was just a job, a chore. The same old routine.&quot; He gestured dismissively with his uninjured hand. &quot;I&rsquo;m sick of it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Sameer who spoke next, a grim smirk twisting his lips. He hadn&#39;t said a word until now. &quot;You know what was fun? Yercaud. That was a masterpiece.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vikram and Sandy both nodded, a shared memory passing between them, a sick nostalgia for a trauma they had created. Six months ago, in Yercaud, they had found a new, more refined kind of torment. They had gone there to meet a friend of Vikram&#39;s, Mahesh, a local who&#39;d given them the tip about a lone woman checking into the hotel. Mahesh, curious about their &quot;work,&quot; had tagged along. Their usual target: a lone woman. But a twist had come when the woman&#39;s husband showed up out of nowhere, finding them already inside his wife&#39;s room. They had knocked him from behind, and he collapsed to the floor. Thinking he was unconscious, they turned their attention back to the woman. But moments later, he suddenly stood back up, a look of pure, unadulterated rage on his face. He had fought back, injuring both Sameer and Mahesh. But he was no match for Vikram&#39;s gym body, and soon, Vikram had him pinned to the ground. The suffering wasn&#39;t just about revenge; it was a spectacle, an art form. Out of spite, it was Sameer&#39;s idea to tie him up and make him watch. The image of the husband, tied to that chair, his helpless rage and agony, had opened a new door. The wife&#39;s pleas, her frantic cries of &quot;Don&#39;t look,&quot; still echoed in their minds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sameer chuckled darkly, lost in the memory. &quot;That little one was a pain, though. Good thing I had the shot ready.&quot; He had his own habit of carrying a dose of a special anesthetic, just in case an unplanned guest showed up. But he hadn&#39;t adjusted the dose for the child&#39;s age and weight. &quot;By the time we were done and were about to leave, he had stopped breathing. Not that it mattered,&quot; Sameer concluded with a shrug.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sandy and Vikram simply nodded. They understood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Let&#39;s do the same with Aditi,&quot; Vikram suggested, the idea forming as he spoke. &quot;Let&#39;s tie up her husband too. The bastard took Aditi away from me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The idea resonated. It was a perfect blend of their sick revenge and their preferred method of torment. Sameer&#39;s face broke into a full smile, and Sandy&#39;s silent gaze turned to Vikram, a flicker of approval in his eyes. The plan was set in motion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Alright, boys, let&#39;s get to work,&quot; Vikram said, pulling out his laptop and opening a new browser window. &quot;I already know everything about her. She&#39;s a journalist, active on social media. She&rsquo;s not careful. We&#39;ll find her location in a minute.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sameer and Sandy leaned in as Vikram navigated to her Instagram. He clicked through her photos, his eyes scanning for any hint of a pattern. &quot;Look here,&quot; he said, pointing to a series of posts. &quot;These are all from a small cafe near her office, tagged &#39;My daily dose of caffeine.&#39; It&#39;s not her home, but it&#39;s a start.&quot; He opened another tab and pulled up Google Street View, navigating to the cafe. &quot;Okay, now look at this photo from a few months ago. In the corner, just barely visible, there&#39;s a unique street sign.&quot; He zoomed in. &quot;It says &#39;Kalyan Nagar.&#39; Confirmed. That&#39;s the neighborhood.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now the hunt for the house began. He scrolled through her tagged photos, ignoring the public ones, and focused on pictures tagged with her husband&#39;s profile. &quot;Her husband&#39;s a ghost online, but she tags him,&quot; Vikram muttered. He found a set of photos from their anniversary, the same day as the Taj Mahal picture. He zoomed in on a photo where they were holding a cake. In the background, a distinctive potted plant and a unique, wrought-iron window grill were visible. &ldquo;This clearly feels like a house, not an apartment, maybe we could search with these details on a listing site&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Wait,&quot; Sandy said, his voice quiet but firm. &quot;Regular real estate sites won&#39;t do anything with that. My last tech client was building an AI-powered property software. It&#39;s a prototype, but it indexes homes by visual data from public photos, not just addresses. It even cross-references with Google Street View. They gave me a unique URL to test it out. Good thing I came here directly from the office. I have my laptop with me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vikram&rsquo;s eyes gleamed with interest. &quot;An AI that can do that? I have to see it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sandy pulled out his own laptop and typed the unique URL into the browser. He quickly pulled up a clean, minimalist interface. &quot;Okay, now give me the details you found,&quot; he said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vikram dictated the visual details: &quot;Bengaluru, Kalyan Nagar, Individual house, Wrought-iron window grill, red gate, distinctive potted plant in the foreground.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sandy input the keywords and then uploaded the photos of the plant and the grill. The AI began to cross-reference these images with street view data and public photos of homes in the Kalyan Nagar area. A search bar showed a green progress bar as the AI worked. In a matter of seconds, a single result appeared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He clicked on the listing. The photo showed the same window grill, the same gate, the same street view. It was a match. The address was perfect. &quot;Remote area, no close neighbors. Perfect for our work,&quot; he said, his voice laced with a cold, triumphant satisfaction. &quot;We can do the work at the victim&#39;s place for a change.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The plan solidified. Sandy, ever the meticulous one, used his contacts to gather more information, confirming that the couple lived alone. With all the necessary details secured, the trio went to their apartment four days later, at midnight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The silence of the night was a perfect cover. With a practiced ease that came from years of committing similar acts, the trio bypassed the lock and slipped inside the house, a dark, sprawling bungalow with an unsettlingly empty feeling. They moved like shadows through the dimly lit hallway, their footsteps swallowed by the plush runner. The house had a sterile, curated feel&mdash;a perfect home straight out of a magazine, a stark contrast to the violence they were about to unleash within it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They found Aditi and her husband in the master bedroom, a room dominated by a large, king size bed. The air hung with the faint scent of lavender, and a soft streetlamp glow filtered through the open window. It was a picture of domestic tranquility that they were about to shatter. The husband was the first to fall, a swift, silent blow from behind that crumpled him to the floor, leaving him unconscious. Aditi&rsquo;s eyes, wide with shock, landed on Vikram. The recognition, the dawning horror in her gaze, was a moment of pure, unadulterated triumph for him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Vikram?&rdquo; she whispered, her voice a fragile thing in the quiet room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A triumphant, joyous smile spread across Vikram&rsquo;s face. This wasn&#39;t a job or a chore; this was personal. He was finally getting his revenge. He grabbed her, and her pleas were muffled by a cloth that Sameer shoved into her mouth. The husband, still unconscious, was now tied to a heavy wooden chair and placed to face the bed, his helpless rage a silent agony as he came to and watched.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They pleaded and begged, but the pleas were meaningless. Sandy and Sameer offered Vikram to go first. &quot;Aditi was a horny one,&quot; he said, his smile stretching. &quot;She was never satisfied with me, so hopefully the three of us can do that for her.&quot; He looked at the husband, a cruel glint in his eyes. &quot;Were you able to satisfy her? If not, you can join us too!&quot; he laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After they had their way with her, they began their signature routine, the one that had kept them free from getting caught in all their previous works. Sameer, with his clinical skill, meticulously wiped away all marks and details that would suggest a sexual assault. For a sick parody of a final act of devotion, Vikram dressed Aditi in a beautiful, wrinkle-free dress, a deliberate act to make the cops&#39; first guess less likely to be rape. Meanwhile, Sandy combed the house, eliminating all evidence of their presence&mdash;fingerprints, any stray hairs, and any signs they had been there. He also made sure to get rid of any CCTV footage and had told the others to not even have their phones on to prevent any geotagging. He then searched for valuables, took them, and deliberately messed up the house, so that it would look like a burglary gone wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, Sameer, with a steady hand, approached Aditi. &quot;Hope you are finally satisfied!&quot; he said, a sick parody of a kind voice. As her horrified and tired eyes watched him, he slit her throat, a silent, efficient movement. As he finished, Sandy spoke, his voice a low hum in the quiet room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Do the husband too,&quot; he said. &quot;The last I heard, the Yercaud one was alive.&quot;</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A week after the incident</span><span class="c0">, the trio was back in Vikram&rsquo;s spacious apartment, a week of cold, triumphant satisfaction settling in their veins. The smell of stale whiskey and a lingering metallic scent still filled the air. Sameer, his face impassive, gestured to the television.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;They&#39;re talking about it again,&quot; he said, his voice flat. A news report about a brutal double murder in Kalyan Nagar flashed across the bottom. &quot;So clueless. They won&#39;t connect it to Yercaud. Different city, different number of people. It&#39;s perfect.&quot; His contempt for the police was palpable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It was so much better this time,&quot; Sandy said, his voice full of a disturbing pride. &quot;No loose ends. We finished the husband too. He won&#39;t be talking to anyone. And the police will never connect it to Yercaud. They don&#39;t know there were four of us then. Mahesh stayed behind.&quot; The trio chuckled at the memory, a secret they would never share. They had just left the husband from Yercaud to die, but here, they had been thorough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We finished what we started, unlike that time,&quot; Vikram said, a grim reminder of their first, incomplete work. The thrill of the night before still buzzed in his veins. He smiled, a look of vindication on his face. &quot;The husband was the best part,&quot; he said, a low growl of satisfaction in his voice. &quot;The way he looked when he saw what we were doing. His body was so strong, so big, but it was just a cage. You could see his soul shatter.&quot; He was still thinking about the man they had left with a slit throat. &quot;It&#39;s a different kind of pleasure when they watch, you know? When all their strength means nothing. That&#39;s a lesson he&#39;ll never forget.&quot; The others just nodded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The men, their conversation now a low, chilling murmur, settled into a comfortable silence, each lost in the grim memories of their past. The bond between them was a strange and fragile thing, a shared pathology born from a deep-seated need for revenge against a world they felt had wronged them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Mahesh called me this morning,&quot; Vikram said, breaking the silence. &quot;He invited us to come to Yercaud soon. Said he&#39;s been thinking about our last job there and can&#39;t wait for the next one.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sameer and Sandy exchanged a look, a flicker of approval in their eyes. Mahesh was their loose end, a local they had brought in on their first big show, but he was also a known quantity, a friend of Vikram&#39;s who they trusted. Mahesh, despite his quiet demeanor, had a past that was just as twisted as their own. As a teenager, he had been used by the older women in his village for their pleasure, and he had enjoyed it, a fact he had confessed to Vikram in a drunken haze one night. His pleasure was derived from his ability to control them, to make them do what he wanted. His respect for Vikram was rooted in this dark past, and he saw their crimes as an extension of his own sick pleasure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;He&#39;s a good kid,&quot; Sandy said, his voice a surprising note of sincerity. &quot;He looks up to Vikram, you know? He thinks what we do is&hellip; an art form. He&#39;s a true connoisseur.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vikram just smiled, a cruel twist of his lips. He knew Mahesh&#39;s respect was rooted in a morbid fascination with their crimes, a fascination that Vikram himself cultivated. He knew that Mahesh, with his humble demeanor and his quiet life in Yercaud, was a willing accomplice, a pawn in a game he didn&#39;t fully understand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The conversation turned to their next target. Sameer, the planner, began to sketch out a new plan, a new narrative for their next performance. It would be a new city, a new victim, and a new story of agony and despair. They were artists, and the world was their canvas. But they were artists who left nothing but destruction and death in their wake. They didn&#39;t know that their final masterpiece was already in the making, and that they were its unwitting stars.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Breaking the silence, Vikram spoke, &quot;Mahesh called me this morning. He invited us to Yercaud soon. Said he&#39;s been thinking about our last job there and can&#39;t wait for the next one.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sameer and Sandy exchanged a look, a flicker of approval in their eyes.

They didn&#39;t know that their final masterpiece was already in the making, and that they were its unwitting stars.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">A sudden, jarring sound cut through the air, causing all three men to flinch. Sandy&rsquo;s work phone, which he never used for personal needs, vibrated with a loud, insistent ring. He looked at the caller ID, saw the name &quot;Mahesh,&quot; and a flicker of shock crossed his face. He picked it up, his voice hushed and strained, a man who never mixed business with pleasure unless absolutely necessary.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&quot;Mahesh, what the hell?&quot; he hissed, his eyes darting to Sameer and Vikram. &quot;I told you, never call this number.&quot;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">There was a frantic, whispered reply from the other end. Sandy&#39;s breath hitched, his composed posture turning rigid. This was a new variable, an unexpected complication in a perfectly executed plan. He held the phone away from his ear for a moment, absorbing the information.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&quot;I know&hellip; I know, but this is a situation, sir,&quot; Mahesh&rsquo;s panicked voice crackled from the receiver. &quot;There is a couple here, asking unwanted questions, at the hotel. Questions about that incident. The guy, sir&hellip; he looks like the husband from that day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">Sandy&rsquo;s breath caught in his throat. He put the phone on speaker, Mahesh&rsquo;s voice, a terrified whisper, filled the silent room.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&ldquo;The lady wants to see the room too. I&hellip; I told them it&rsquo;s closed for repairs, but she&rsquo;s not buying it. What should I do? He&hellip; he keeps looking at me like he knows. Please sir, we need to do something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">In a low, confident voice, Sandy said, &quot;Let them see the room. They&#39;re not gonna find anything there; it happened six months ago.&quot; He hung up the phone. The trio sat in silence, their carefully constructed reality crumbling around them. The &quot;ghost&quot; they had created was not a ghost at all. It was alive, and it had come back to haunt them.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&#8203;Sandy took a slow, deliberate sip of his whiskey, the amber liquid a stark contrast to his now cold, resolute eyes. He placed the glass down and looked at Vikram. &quot;You have to go,&quot; he said, his voice low and firm. &quot;We can&#39;t have loose ends. Not with this one. Use Mahesh and any local goons needed; we have the money from Aditi&rsquo;s house!&quot;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&#8203;Vikram finished his own glass in one long gulp, the burn in his throat a welcome sensation. He slammed the empty glass on the table and nodded slowly, a cruel smile spreading across his face. &quot;I know. It&#39;s time to finish our unfinished work.&quot;</span></p><p class="c11 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c11 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c17 c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span><br></span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h1 class="c11 c20" id="h.1eqfattl2avi"><span class="c23 c2">Chapter 11: The Pursuit</span></h1><p class="c14"><span class="c17 c2">(4 days after the Kalyan Nagar Incident) 2:30am Somewhere between Mandya and Mysore</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Knock! Knock! Knock!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sound tore through the quiet of the night, a sharp, insistent demand that sliced through the heavy blanket of sleep. It was followed by the peaceful silence of the neighborhood. The two-story house, a modest structure of white walls and a red-tiled roof, stood as a beacon of stillness in the early hours. A small, carefully tended garden with a few flowering plants lined the neat, tiled path to the front door. Just beside the door, a simple brass nameplate was affixed to the wall, its polished surface reflecting the faint moonlight. Etched into its surface were two lines: ARVIND KUMAR and below it, Deputy Superintendent of Police.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;After 5 missed calls, they have even come to my home now! It&rsquo;s actually that bad ha?&rdquo; Arvind muttered to himself, lying on his bed, the words a low rumble in the darkness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had been in a deep sleep when the first call had arrived, the shrill ring of his phone tearing through the quiet. With a practiced reflex, he immediately turned the phone to silent mode. He then shifted his gaze to the other side of the bed, where his wife, Jeni, was sleeping peacefully, her snores a soft, barely audible hum. A faint smile touched his lips, and he closed his eyes again, but sleep would not return.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In his mind&rsquo;s eye, he saw the caller information. It was Sub Inspector Gokul, his new subordinate. Arvind knew the man well enough to understand he was both decent and afraid of his superior. Gokul would never dare call him on his private number on his own, not at this hour, unless he was under direct orders from a senior officer. But at that moment, Arvind simply didn&rsquo;t want to lose his sleep. He knew that if he answered the call, he would have to leave for the office immediately. He chose to ignore it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The phone vibrated a second time, then a third, and a fourth. And then, a long, unnerving silence. Arvind had anticipated the vibrations, but the gap after the fourth missed call filled him with a dual-edged sense of dread. On one hand, he hoped they had decided to wait until morning, which would suggest the issue wasn&#39;t critical. On the other hand, the cynic in him knew that this pause meant they were now on their way to his home, signaling an issue of far greater seriousness. He lay still, eyes closed, waiting. Twenty minutes crawled by, and the phone vibrated for the fifth and final time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Knock! Knock! Knock!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A moment later, the three knocks came, a single, deliberate set of raps on the front door. He knew it must be his driver, Constable Murugan, a man too old-school to use a calling bell. Gokul must have brought him along for support, as he was new to the act of waking up a senior officer in the middle of the night.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arvind was already out of bed when his wife, Jeni was about to sit up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for me,&rdquo; he whispered, waving a hand. &ldquo;You sleep, I&rsquo;ll handle this.&rdquo; She fell back against the pillows, a soft sigh escaping her lips, she had expected that exact phrase. This was a familiar ritual, one that had been perfected over years of middle-of-the-night calls. He moved towards the door, a faint smile touching his lips. &ldquo;Nobody likes to be disturbed in mid sleep,&rdquo; he thought to himself, but in his mind, he knew that his wife&rsquo;s ability to fall back asleep at a moment&rsquo;s notice was nothing short of a superpower.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was no knocking anymore. Murugan knew Arvind well, having been his driver for more than a decade. He knew his boss would wake with the slightest noise at the door and had no intention of overdoing it, which would only lead to him getting scolded later. The silence was profound, broken only by the hum of the air conditioner and Jeni&rsquo;s gentle snores. Just as Murugan&rsquo;s hand was about to make contact with the door again, the lamps above them flickered on, bathing the front porch in a soft, yellow light. Arvind moved to the spy hole and checked the identities of his visitors. It was Murugan and Gokul, just as he had suspected, but they were not alone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a weary sigh, Arvind unbolted the door and stepped onto the porch. As he did, Murugan, Gokul, and the third man snapped to attention, their hands rising to their foreheads in a crisp, synchronized salute. Arvind, however, did not return the gesture, his expression a cold mask of annoyance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sudden brightness of the lamps made him squint, but he saw the faces of Murugan and Gokul clearly, their expressions a mix of professional stiffness and genuine fatigue. Beside them stood a third man, whom Arvind did not immediately recognize. He was an Inspector, by the looks of his uniform, but his face was an unreadable mask.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arvind&#39;s gaze fell on Gokul, and his frustration flared. &ldquo;What is it, Gokul? And why have you dragged poor Murugan out here in the middle of the night? Is there no sense of decency anymore?&rdquo; His voice was a low, controlled growl, but the anger was unmistakable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a murder, sir, In Kalyan Nagar&rdquo; Gokul replied, his voice a nervous whisper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arvind scoffed, his hands on his hips. &ldquo;So from when did the DSP and the special unit start investigating every murder case in the Bengaluru city?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gokul&#39;s eyes darted nervously before he spoke, the words coming out in a rush. &quot;Sir, a lady from Kalyan Nagar, who lives two doors down the crime scene, noticed something strange. Her dog, which usually loves to play, kept stopping dead in front of this particular house and wouldn&#39;t move. It would just sit there, whimpering, and refuse to go any further. The next day, the same thing happened, and they finally rang the doorbell, but no one answered. The silence was unsettling, but it was the faint, sickly sweet odor that settled over their porch that made them call for us. They asked for someone to do a welfare check, and that&#39;s when we... we found the body.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At this, the third man stepped forward. &quot;Sir, I&#39;m Inspector Rajkumar. I&#39;m the SHO of Kalyan Nagar Station. This case falls under my jurisdiction.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then why are you here?&rdquo; Arvind asked, looking directly at Gokul. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not usual for a SI from Mysore to walk into a crime scene in Bengaluru.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gokul explained the reason. He was in Bengaluru, visiting his family and his friend, Inspector Rajkumar. He was with Rajkumar when the news of two bodies was informed to the SHO through the dispatch&rsquo;s wireless. When he heard about the discovery, Gokul volunteered to come with him. Rajkumar hesitated, but since he was the SHO, it wasn&rsquo;t unusual for him to have a different police officer accompany him. They visited the spot, and forensics said the time of death could be four days back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arvind&#39;s eyes narrowed, a new kind of anger bubbling up. &quot;Then why couldn&#39;t you have just come in the morning, if you had all the details? Don&#39;t tell me you couldn&#39;t be a little more professional about this. Is that why you brought Murugan here? To show me how urgent this is?&quot; he asked, his voice now dangerously soft.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gokul swallowed hard, the words tumbling out in a desperate confession. &quot;Sir, the case... it&#39;s not assigned yet. I was scared that someone else might get the case before us. I... I wanted to make sure you were the one to get it, sir. I wanted you to see the crime spot before they moved the bodies.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The air went still. Murugan looked down at his feet. Rajkumar&#39;s expression remained neutral, but a flicker of something passed through his eyes. Arvind&#39;s own face went from controlled fury to a mixture of disbelief and outrage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Why?&quot; he seethed, the single word hanging in the air like a threat. &quot;Don&#39;t drag on! Just tell me what is it? Finish everything at once,&quot; he demanded, his patience at an end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gokul&#39;s shoulders slumped. He knew this was the moment of truth. He took a deep breath. &ldquo;Sir, the deceased are a husband and wife, Kiran and Aditi. They were the two residents. The house was a total mess&mdash;furniture overturned, drawers pulled out, it looked like a robbery that went bad. The CCTV cameras were ripped out, and the whole system was gone. But that&rsquo;s not what worries me, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He paused, his eyes flicking to Arvind&rsquo;s face to check if the DSP was still listening. Arvind&#39;s posture was still rigid, his expression a stormy mask of impatience, but he hadn&#39;t moved. He was listening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gokul continued, his voice dropping to a near whisper. &ldquo;It&#39;s how Aditi was killed. She was found on the bed with her throat slit. Her husband, Kiran, was tied up in a chair right next to her. The slit to her throat, sir&hellip; it was very similar to the murder we investigated in Mysore more than a week ago. The lone victim there, Leela, was killed the exact same way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arvind simply shook his head, a single, deliberate motion, and walked into the house, leaving the three of them standing on the porch. The door closed behind him with a soft click, plunging them into a heavy silence. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>A few months ago, Gokul was transferred to Mysore from Bengaluru, and it wasn&#39;t long before he came to know of </span><span class="c2">Arvind Kumar</span><span class="c0">, the DSP who was something of an underdog legend in the police circles of Mysore and Mandya. Gokul had a chance to witness Arvind&#39;s reputation firsthand when they worked together on a complex case. He was a junior officer, but Arvind&#39;s unconventional methods and razor-sharp intellect had left a lasting impression on him. They successfully closed the case, and from then on, Gokul&#39;s professional respect for the senior officer was absolute.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Nine days ago, a new murder case landed on his desk. As the SI in charge, Gokul was the first on the scene, personally investigating the body of a lone woman named Leela, her throat slit in a manner that chilled him. He poured everything he had into the investigation. Two days later, after the initial findings, the police leadership decided the case required a specialized approach and formed a </span><span class="c2">Special Investigation Team (SIT)</span><span class="c0">. They put DSP Arvind in charge, and because Gokul had worked directly on the Mysore case and Arvind knew him personally, Arvind made him a part of the SIT.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gokul was eager to prove his worth. He knew everything about the Mysore case, from the victims&#39; personal details to the crime scene&#39;s smallest nuances. He was determined to solve this mystery. That determination is what fueled him when, just four days later, another body was found in Bengaluru, a copycat of the Mysore murder. He knew he had to act, and he knew there was only one person who could truly connect the dots.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rajkumar was the first to break it, his voice filled with a mixture of disbelief and frustration. &quot;Is he always like this? With so much attitude?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Murugan sighed, looking at Gokul, who just stared at the closed door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a newcomer to his team, just joined a week ago, but as far as I know, yes,&rdquo; Gokul finally said, his voice flat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How do you people work with him?&rdquo; Rajkumar asked, his exasperation growing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;ll get used to it, I guess. That&#39;s the way he works, and you get to learn a lot from him,&quot; Gokul said, a hint of respect in his tone. &quot;And it&#39;s not like he never appreciates you. He does, if you do a good job. Otherwise, you get &hellip;.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;But he didn&#39;t say anything just now, when you mentioned the similarity of the slits,&quot; Rajkumar pressed, his voice rising in disbelief. &quot;I told you this was a bad idea. No seniors in our department take their juniors&#39; suggestions seriously!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gokul remained silent, his gaze still fixed on the house.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So what do you say?&quot; Rajkumar continued. &quot;You really think he didn&#39;t hear all five of my missed calls?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Sir would have noticed it on the first ring of the first call itself,&quot; Murugan replied, a mysterious smile on his face. &quot;But&hellip;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;But what?&quot; Rajkumar demanded, leaning in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;But Sir wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered. Sir is always detached from serious stuff.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Meaning?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Meaning, Sir never takes anything seriously, until Sir himself gets involved,&quot; Murugan explained. &quot;Sir doesn&#39;t care about who waged war against whom, until someone makes him fight the war.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rajkumar shook his head, a look of grim resignation on his face. &ldquo;Great. Looks like we&rsquo;ve got a hell of a personality to work with. And he hasn&rsquo;t even said a word about whether he&rsquo;s taking up the case. I&rsquo;m supposed to report this to my ACP first, but because of you, I&#39;m here. If Sir doesn&#39;t accept the case, I need to call ACP Sir immediately and come up with some reason for the delay, too.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s already very late,&quot; Gokul said, a hint of a tired smile on his face. &quot;By the time you reach Bengaluru, you can just call ACP sir and tell him you waited so you wouldn&#39;t disturb his sleep.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What about my sleep?&quot; Rajkumar stared at Gokul. &quot;Is this all a waste now?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;He might look a bit lazy and disinterested,&quot; Gokul said, looking away from the house and finally meeting Rajkumar&rsquo;s gaze. &quot;But he&rsquo;s very clever. That&rsquo;s what I learned about him from the one mission I worked with him. That&rsquo;s why, even though the commissioner never liked him, he still personally asked for him to lead the special unit. Am I right, Muruganna?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes,&quot; Murugan agreed. &quot;Sir always gets very difficult missions, and Sir has always completed them.&quot;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">And they were both right. Arvind wasn&#39;t someone who valued a person&#39;s insight based on their rank or experience. He believed that everyone had a different perspective on a case, and only by taking in all the inputs, no matter how trivial they seemed, could you truly solve a case.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Five minutes later, the door to the house opened. Arvind emergedin a new, clean set of clothes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looked at Murugan. &ldquo;Get the car.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he turned to Gokul, a direct look in his eyes. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re not wasting my time. Send me all the case details and the crime scene location. We&rsquo;ll meet there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A wave of relief washed over Gokul and Rajkumar. &quot;Yes, Sir!&quot; they said in unison. As Arvind&#39;s car pulled away, Gokul looked at Rajkumar, a silent, knowing smile on his face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The car hummed to life, and Arvind settled into the front passenger seat. Unlike many of his colleagues who preferred the relative comfort and authority of the back, Arvind always claimed the front. &quot;Better AC reception,&quot; he&#39;d often joke, but the truth was he liked the proximity to the road, the direct view of what was to come. He pulled out a slim, encrypted tablet, its screen a lone source of light in the dark interior.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you get roped into this?&rdquo; Arvind asked Murugan, his eyes still on the glowing screen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Murugan, ever the pragmatist, answered calmly. &ldquo;Gokul sir called me about three hours ago and asked if it was okay to call you. I told him it was better not to disturb you in your sleep, but he insisted it was very urgent. When I asked where he was, he said he was in Bengaluru. I told him you might never answer the call, so it would be better to come in person and call when they were close. He was very nervous and requested if I could join him. Since my house is just nearby, when they were close, he gave me a missed call, and I came and waited.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arvind shook his head, a faint, wry smile touching his lips. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you guys ever sleep? So it looks like you&rsquo;re the mastermind of this whole situation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No sir!&rdquo; Murugan responded with a soft chuckle. &ldquo;He&#39;s a good kid, just eager, I feel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Eagerness and goodness are fine,&quot; Arvind said, his voice dropping slightly as he scrolled through files. &quot;But this was a high-risk move for both of them. They should have gone through the proper channels. If it weren&#39;t for me, you know very well what would happen to them. We weren&#39;t like this when we were their age. I&rsquo;m not sure if they&rsquo;re getting brave, or if we&rsquo;re just getting soft.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He opened a digital folder labeled &quot;S.I.T.&quot; on his device. Inside, two folders were visible: one for Mysore and one for Mandya. He opened the Mysore folder, which contained a multitude of images and documents. He opened a photo of the victim&rsquo;s neck, zooming in to study the precise, gruesome cut. With a few taps, he compared it side-by-side with the new photo Gokul had sent. The similarities were chillingly precise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He returned to the S.I.T. folder, created a new one, and named it &quot;Kalyan Nagar.&quot; He then copied and pasted all the details Gokul had shared, the files appearing as a new collection of clues waiting to be pieced together. He knew, with a certainty that settled deep in his bones, that this case was now officially his.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arvind&rsquo;s car was the first to arrive at the Kalyan Nagar crime scene, pulling up to a dark, sprawling bungalow at precisely 5:30 am. Despite his age, Murugan proved why skill matters, navigating the early-morning Bengaluru traffic with the precision of a seasoned pro. Arvind didn&#39;t wait. He showed his ID to the constables guarding the perimeter and, with a curt nod, entered the house.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The bungalow had an unsettlingly empty feeling, a perfect home right out of a magazine, a stark and sterile canvas that now held a scene of pure chaos. It was a deliberate, curated mess&mdash;furniture overturned, drawers pulled out, a clumsy attempt to mimic a robbery gone wrong. He moved like a ghost through the ransacked living room and down the dimly lit hallway, his eyes scanning for anything that didn&#39;t belong. The house was trying to lie to him, and he could feel it. He found what he was looking for in the master bedroom, a room dominated by a large, king-size bed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The bodies were just as the reports had described: a man and a woman, Kiran and Aditi. Aditi lay on the bed, her body a silent, peaceful contradiction to the gruesome scene. She was dressed in a beautiful, wrinkle-free dress, a disturbing detail that immediately set off alarms in Arvind&#39;s mind. Her throat was slit, a clean, precise cut that he knew intimately from the photos of the Mysore case. The man, Kiran, was tied to a heavy wooden chair beside the bed, his head lolled to one side, his face a frozen mask of silent agony. His throat was also slit, a sloppy, cruel cut. The sight of the husband tied to the chair, forced to watch, was a new, chilling detail.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just then, a hurried rush of footsteps sounded from the hallway. Gokul and Rajkumar burst into the room, their faces pale and their breaths coming in ragged gasps. They had arrived.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After Rajkumar and Gokul arrived at the Kalyan Nagar crime scene, Arvind gestured for a briefing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sir, the house was a mess,&quot; Rajkumar began, his voice a low monotone as he recited the standard report. &quot;Drawers were pulled out, furniture was overturned, the CCTV cameras were ripped out. It was a classic case of a robbery that went wrong. We believe the couple must have seen the robbers, and that&rsquo;s why they were killed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arvind&rsquo;s expression didn&rsquo;t change. &quot;Are you sure?&quot; he asked, his voice calm but with an undercurrent of skepticism.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rajkumar hesitated, glancing at Gokul. &quot;I... I have my doubts, sir, especially after discussing with him.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What doubts?&quot; Arvind pressed, his eyes fixed on Rajkumar. &quot;Speak for yourself.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, sir, there are no traces of fingerprints, no stray hairs, nothing. The place is clean. They could have worn gloves, I know, and thieves are getting careful these days, but it&rsquo;s still unusual. I also noticed that the cut on the victim&rsquo;s throat... it matches the details Gokul shared with me about the case in Mysore.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arvind&rsquo;s gaze hardened. &quot;Tell me this, do you really see a similarity, or are you just supporting your friend here?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rajkumar shifted uncomfortably, his eyes darting between Arvind and Gokul. &quot;I&#39;m not that sure, sir. They all look the same, but different too.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arvind nodded slowly, then turned his attention to Gokul. &quot;You tell me. Why do you think this is not a robbery gone wrong and why do you think it matches the Mysore case?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gokul, a new confidence in his eyes, stepped forward. &quot;Sir, I handled the Leela case in Mysore. Her body was dumped near a lake, and she had a precise, surgical cut on her throat. Her valuables were missing, which made it look like a robbery, but there were no signs of a struggle. The forensic team couldn&#39;t find any evidence of sexual assault, even though we looked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Now, here in Kalyan Nagar, we have a double murder. The house is staged to look like a robbery, and valuables are missing. But, sir, Aditi&#39;s body was also meticulously cleaned and dressed in a new, wrinkle-free dress. And the cuts on both their throats are the same as Leela&#39;s.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&quot;Sir, a common robber wouldn&#39;t have this kind of surgical precision. And they certainly wouldn&#39;t have the time or the inclination to meticulously clean and dress their victims&#39; bodies in a new dress. This isn&#39;t a random act of violence, sir; this is a </span><span class="c2">serial killer&#39;s signature.</span><span class="c0">&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s a lot of flaws in your theory,&rdquo; Arvind replied, his voice flat. &ldquo;I agree both cases involve a show of robbery, whether fake or not, and the throats are slit. But answer me this: the cuts aren&#39;t an exact match, are they? The length is different. It could just be a similar knife or blade, couldn&#39;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gokul nodded, though he didn&#39;t want to. He had seen the subtle differences, but he had dismissed them as inconsequential.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay, leave that,&rdquo; Arvind continued, his words a dismissive wave of his hand. &ldquo;Your clean and wrinkle-free dress theory. Last I checked, Leela&#39;s was not clean or wrinkle-free, so that&#39;s not a match, either.&rdquo; Gokul nodded again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arvind&rsquo;s eyes moved to the blood-soaked bedsheets beneath Aditi&rsquo;s body. &ldquo;And the victim there was killed somewhere and dumped somewhere, but here, the murders happened right here.&rdquo; He gestured with a sharp movement. &ldquo;The blood splatter on the bedsheets below the victims shows that.&rdquo; He paused, turning to Rajkumar. &ldquo;Am I right, Raj?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rajkumar nodded. &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arvind continued, his voice a low, steady challenge. &ldquo;Plus, here they murdered the husband too. In the case of a serial killer, there should be a pattern: the type of victim, the number of victims, the presentation of the victim, the choice of location, the method of action. All of these are different. Do you really think this can&#39;t be a robbery gone wrong and not at all related to the Mysore case?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gokul&rsquo;s shoulders slumped. He felt his carefully constructed theory unraveling. &quot;Yes, sir. Sorry for wasting your time. I&#39;m ready for any punishment.&quot; His instinct, however, still screamed that there was a connection.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, a sound filled the room. Arvind laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tch, tch, tch,&rdquo; Arvind said, his voice a low, clucking sound of pity. He shook his head slowly. &ldquo;You gave up so fast, bro!&rdquo; He paused, a faint smirk touching his lips as he glanced at Rajkumar. &ldquo;Isn&#39;t that how you guys call each other these days?&rdquo; He turned his gaze back to Gokul. &ldquo;A policeman has to trust his instincts no matter what. Because our logical brain might not be able to connect all the dots, but the part of the brain that processes patterns can easily, and that&#39;s your instinct.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arvind pulled out his tablet. With a few taps, he opened a folder labeled &quot;S.I.T.&quot; Inside, there were two folders: &quot;Mysore&quot; and &quot;Mandya&quot;. He opened the &quot;Mandya&quot; folder and handed the tablet to Gokul to see.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Both Rajkumar and Gokul leaned in, their eyes glued to the tablet screen. Gokul tapped on the &quot;case details&quot; file, and they read the summary of the Mandya murder from a year ago. The victim was a 40-year-old woman named Shyla, a retired English teacher who had recently gotten divorced. Her body was found sleeping on the bed of a rented Airbnb apartment, wearing a new, wrinkle-free dress. The owner, who became concerned when she didn&#39;t answer his calls, found her. Her valuables were missing. The local police, baffled by the crime scene, initially considered it a difficult-to-inflict suicide. But Arvind, based on his early intuition, rejected that theory, which is why the case remained unsolved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After reading the case details, Gokul opened the photos. A collective gasp escaped their lips as they saw the victim. The precise slit on the neck, the clean, wrinkle-free dress, the missing ornaments&mdash;it was all there. They looked up at Arvind, who began to speak, his voice low and deliberate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;When you match the cuts between victims to see if they&#39;re made by the same person, you don&#39;t match the length; you match the depth,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I can drag a knife or a blade as far as I want, but a person&#39;s depth of pressure remains consistent in similar situations. Plus, the sharpness of the blade can also be determined from the perfection of the edges of the torn skin. This is definitely a surgical blade. Of course, we need to bring this body to the morgue and compare it directly with Leela&#39;s by some experts to say it&#39;s an exact match. The cuts between Shyla, the Mandya victim, and Leela are already a match. So, if we can confirm Aditi and Kiran&#39;s cuts are the same as Leela&#39;s, then we have our serial killer&#39;s signature connecting all three.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And that brings me to your clean dress theory, which matches between Shyla and Aditi&rsquo;s cases. It&rsquo;s mainly because the killers had access to their alternative clothes&mdash;Shyla&#39;s luggage in the Airbnb, and Aditi&#39;s wardrobe here. Most probably, since Leela was kidnapped somewhere outside, they had to reuse the dress she was already in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rajkumar&#39;s brow furrowed in confusion. &ldquo;What about Shyla&rsquo;s and Aditi&rsquo;s dresses they were wearing before?&rdquo; he asked, a thought suddenly occurring to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arvind&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;Did you find any used dresses dumped somewhere?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, sir,&quot; Rajkumar replied, his voice barely a whisper. &quot;Not even in the laundry baskets.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Same was the case with Shyla&#39;s.&rdquo; replied Arvind &ldquo;Maybe the psychopaths took them with them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So it&#39;s more than one guy, sir?&rdquo; Gokul asked, his voice hushed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&#39;t say for sure, but that&#39;s my instinct,&rdquo; Arvind said. &ldquo;They had to overpower a woman without leaving any signs of a struggle. With no drugs involved, it means there was more than one culprit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rajkumar started noting all these details. &ldquo;Is that all, sir?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;One last thing. We might need to do checks for sexual assault.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gokul spoke up. &ldquo;We all thought that way, sir, even for Leela&#39;s case, but the results were always negative.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arvind pointed at Kiran&#39;s body, still tied to the chair, facing the bed. &ldquo;The way this was set up&hellip; the way he was tied to the chair and placed exactly facing the bed&hellip;&rdquo; he said, his voice dropping to a low, chilling whisper. &ldquo;I feel this was a display. A sadistic ritual. A kind of punishment for the husband&mdash;to make him watch, completely incapable, while his wife suffers.&rdquo; He paused, a long, dramatic beat. &ldquo;Just a feeling. But let&#39;s get this checked. In fact, do a detailed test for sexual assault on all three female victims.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But the other two already returned negative, as per the report,&rdquo; Gokul said.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">Arvind&rsquo;s expression remained calm, but his eyes held an unwavering intensity.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&ldquo;A four-day-old body will have already undergone significant decomposition,&rdquo; he began, his voice low and measured. &ldquo;That will have destroyed many of the biological clues. And a common criminal would have left some evidence behind, but these&hellip;&rdquo; he gestured at the scene with a sweep of his hand, &ldquo;&hellip;these are not common criminals.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">He paused, letting the weight of his words settle. &ldquo;We know from the clean dress theory that they care about presentation. So we can expect them to have meticulously wiped away all marks and details that would suggest a sexual assault.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c9">He locked eyes with Gokul. &ldquo;But a skilled forensic team can still find evidence. They can look for </span><span class="c9 c2">subtle physical evidence</span><span class="c5">, like microscopic bruises or micro-tears in the genital or anal regions that would be difficult to clean or conceal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c9">He leaned in slightly. &ldquo;They could also look for </span><span class="c9 c2">DNA from skin cells</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;under the victims&#39; fingernails if they scratched their assailants, or in other protected areas. DNA from multiple individuals would immediately contradict the solo-actor-in-a-robbery theory.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">Arvind straightened up, a final, chilling note of certainty in his voice. &ldquo;The fact that the perpetrators went to such lengths to cover their tracks is, in itself, a clue. I want you to go back to the lab and request that they look for these things.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">Gokul replied with a sharp, &quot;Yes, sir!&quot; He looked excited, as if they had just discovered something groundbreaking, but Arvind&#39;s calm voice interrupted him.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&quot;It&#39;s all a wild theory, so don&#39;t get too excited until we get something solid.&quot;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">Gokul nodded, his initial burst of energy settling into a focused determination. Arvind glanced at his watch. &quot;It&#39;s 7 am. Since I&#39;m here, I&#39;ll meet with the East Zone ACP to discuss taking over this case. What&#39;s his name, Raj?&quot;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&quot;Anand Singh, sir,&quot; Rajkumar replied.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Okay, I&#39;ll meet him at his office at 10 am,&rdquo; Arvind said. &ldquo;Gokul, get some sleep and then get back to Mysore. Coordinate with the lab there to have the bodies of both the female victims&mdash;Shyla and Leela, transported to a centralized forensic lab here in Bengaluru, along with Aditi&rsquo;s and Kiran&rsquo;s bodies. That will allow us to run all the tests in a single location.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">He looked at Rajkumar, a direct command in his eyes. &quot;Raj, please do the needful from here.&quot;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">Both men nodded once more, their movements in sync.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Good work, both of you,&rdquo; Arvind said, and a rare note of genuine praise entered his voice. &ldquo;Gokul, without you we would have never made this connection&mdash;not this fast, at least! And Raj, you took a huge risk, trusting your comrade. That&rsquo;s a good sign for a leader.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; they both said together.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">As Arvind left, Gokul turned to Rajkumar, a wide smile on his face. Rajkumar looked back, a silent understanding passing between them.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c9 c3">No wonder Gokul felt that way about Arvind sir</span><span class="c9">, Rajkumar thought to himself. </span><span class="c9 c3 c25">He&rsquo;s not just a senior officer. He&rsquo;s a leader who doesn&rsquo;t care about rank or ego. He saw something in a junior officer&rsquo;s gut feeling that no one else did, and instead of just taking the credit, he gave it to him. He even saw my small act of faith as a sign of leadership. This isn&#39;t just about solving a case; it&#39;s about building a team. And I think he just built one.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">With that, the three men departed, their paths now connected by a single, chilling signature.</span></p><hr><p class="c11 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">The next day, at 11 am, Gokul called Arvind.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Sir, a quick update,&rdquo; Gokul said, his voice a little strained. &ldquo;We managed to get all the bodies here. Rajkumar handled Aditi&rsquo;s and Kiran&rsquo;s, and I got Leela&rsquo;s and Shyla&rsquo;s from Mysore. They&#39;re all at the centralized forensic lab in Electronic City, Bengaluru.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Arvind said. &ldquo;What&#39;s the timeline?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Sir, I spoke to them,&rdquo; Gokul said, a hint of frustration in his voice. &ldquo;They said we can get a preliminary report and some solid, promising news in about ten days. But to truly connect all three cases with undeniable proof, we would likely have to wait several weeks for the full, detailed forensic reports.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">Arvind&rsquo;s frustration was palpable even through the phone. &ldquo;What! Why so long?&rdquo; he demanded.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">Gokul, flustered, repeated the lab&#39;s explanation word for word. &ldquo;Comparing the precise depth of a surgical cut across three different bodies would require a team of forensic pathologists. This isn&#39;t a quick or easy task. The samples from the Mandya and Mysore cases would need to be re-examined and cross-referenced with the new evidence from Kalyan Nagar. A preliminary report might be available in 3-5 days, but a definitive, court-ready analysis could take up to a week.&rdquo; He then continued, quoting the lab technician. &ldquo;For sexual assault, this is the most complex part of the investigation and would take the longest. Even with the best forensic technology, looking for microscopic bruises and hidden DNA on bodies that are weeks and even a year old is a monumental task, especially since the perpetrators were so meticulous. The DNA analysis alone would take considerable time. A preliminary report might be available in 1-2 weeks, but a comprehensive report that provides a conclusive match could take a month or more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&quot;Gokul!&quot; Arvind shouted, his voice a low growl. &quot;Don&#39;t repeat everything they say word for word. I need a report in three days. Improvise.&quot;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&quot;But how, sir?&quot; Gokul asked, stunned.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&quot;Listen,&quot; Arvind said, his voice dropping to a sharp, clinical tone. &quot;I&#39;m already pretty sure about the surgical cuts. So, tell them to focus fully on the sexual assault test, and mainly on Aditi, since it&#39;s the most recent and less contaminated. After that, they can continue with the other regular tests. Also, inform Rajkumar that the news about our doubt of sexual assault should never reach the media. To them, it&#39;s just a double murder, a robbery gone wrong. Ok?&rdquo;....&ldquo;Three days. Dot.&quot;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">He hung up the call without another word.</span></p><hr><p class="c11 c12"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A week after the Kalyan Nagar incident, DSP Arvind pulled up to the Centralized Forensic Lab in Electronic City, Bengaluru. The morning air was thick with humidity, and a light, persistent drizzle slicked the glass facade of the sterile, imposing building. Gokul and Rajkumar were waiting for him at the entrance, their expressions a mix of anticipation and exhaustion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Sir,&quot; Gokul said, his voice flat. Rajkumar nodded a greeting, his eyes hollow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arvind didn&#39;t waste time with small talk. &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They went inside, the cold, conditioned air a stark contrast to the muggy weather outside. They were led to a sterile examination room where a woman stood waiting. Her hair was pulled back in a tight bun, and her expression was both serious and weary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Dr. Aruna,&quot; Gokul said, introducing her. &quot;This is DSP Arvind.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Aruna gave a curt nod. &quot;I&#39;ve been going through the samples you requested, DSP. You wanted to know if a sexual assault had taken place, especially in the Kalyan Nagar case.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arvind&rsquo;s eyes were locked on hers. &quot;What did you find?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We looked for DNA from skin cells under the victims&#39; fingernails, just as you requested,&quot; she said, her voice clinical. &quot;But even those were wiped clean.&quot; She held up a small, sealed swab. &quot;The test results came back with traces of a commercial cleaning agent&mdash;a strong detergent, specifically.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gokul and Rajkumar exchanged a look of shared disappointment. This was it. The last-ditch effort that came to nothing. They looked crestfallen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Arvind, to their surprise, smiled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You see,&quot; he said, his voice low and confident. &quot;A common criminal would have left some evidence behind, but these are not common criminals. Someone taking the effort to clean the fingernails of Aditi itself is proof enough that something sexual happened and they wanted to hide it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Aruna shook her head, her expression still serious. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not done yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gokul and Rajkumar, who had been on the verge of speaking, fell silent and looked at her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We did find some traces of broken DNA,&quot; she continued, her voice gaining a professional rhythm. &quot;I can&#39;t give you a report on this, as there&#39;s no way to prove it, but I can tell you verbally that these DNA fragments&mdash;though broken&mdash;look like they&#39;re from more than one person.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gokul&#39;s eyes lit up. &quot;That&#39;s good news!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Does it match with Kiran?&quot; Rajkumar asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Aruna replied flatly, raising a finger to halt their next question. &ldquo;I&#39;m not done yet. We also looked for the microscopic bruises or micro-tears in the genital or anal regions as you requested. We found traces of it in both the vaginal and anal regions, confirming the sexual assault.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arvind smiled, but waited patiently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Aruna lowered her hand, a finality in her tone. &quot;We checked Kiran&#39;s reproductive organs to see if he was the one who had sex with her, but no. And there were no cleaning chemicals found on him either. And&hellip; I am done.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arvind spoke first. &quot;Thank you so much, Dr. Aruna. This is enough for us for now. Please continue the other tests. We might need them in the future once we find these psychopaths.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Aruna nodded. Rajkumar and Gokul also thanked her, shaking her hand with a renewed sense of purpose.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">As they walked out of the lab, Arvind was about to head to his car when he stopped. Across the parking lot, he saw a familiar face: Inspector Manoj Kumar.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">Arvind waved at him, and Manoj, seeing him, ran over with a wide smile. &ldquo;Hi, Sir! How come you&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">Arvind smiled back. &ldquo;On duty, Manoj.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&quot;Oh, wow! Here in Bengaluru? You got transferred here? Are you ACP now?&quot; Manoj asked, his eyes wide with a familiar, boyish excitement.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Wait, wait,&rdquo; Arvind said, shaking his head with a chuckle. &ldquo;You never change, always assuming on your own.&rdquo; He watched as Manoj&#39;s smile remained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still DSP, running a Special Investigation Team, and we&#39;re handling the double murder case in Kalyan Nagar.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Oh, I heard about that, Sir,&rdquo; Manoj said, his tone turning serious. &ldquo;Is it linked to some other case?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&quot;Can&#39;t say for sure yet!&quot; Arvind replied.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&quot;Can I see the FIR? It&#39;s been many years since I read an FIR for a case investigated by you. It will be educational,&quot; Manoj asked, a hint of his old, competitive nature surfacing.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Yeah, yeah! You still didn&rsquo;t change,&rdquo; Arvind said with a laugh, but the ring of his phone cut him off. He saw his wife&#39;s name, Jeni, on the screen. He answered. Gokul, reading the room, quickly handed him the Kalyan Nagar case file. While on the phone, Arvind hurriedly introduced both Gokul and Rajkumar as members of his team.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">Manoj quickly flipped through the pages of the report, his eyes scanning for key details. Suddenly, his movements stopped. A frown of concentration creased his brow. &quot;I&rsquo;ve read something similar somewhere,&quot; he said, his voice barely a whisper.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">Arvind&#39;s full attention snapped to him. He hung up the call abruptly, saying, &quot;I will call you back.&quot; His voice was low and intense as he looked at Manoj. &quot;Where?&quot;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">Manoj thought hard, his eyes wandering across the parking lot until they landed on a car with a lawyer&#39;s logo on the windshield. It clicked. He said the name aloud, &quot;Lawyer Zoya.&quot;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">He looked at Arvind, his excitement building. &quot;I have a similar FIR, sir. I had the file on my phone, as I sent a copy of it to lawyer Zoya.&quot; He opened the file and showed it to Arvind, who leaned in. Gokul and Rajkumar peered over his shoulder.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c9">The screen showed </span><span class="c9 c2">FIR No 89/2024 Yercaud Town PS</span><span class="c5">. A case filed six months ago. There it was. A woman dead, lying on a hotel bed, neatly dressed and wrinkle-free, her neck slit, and her husband tied to a chair facing the bed.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&quot;But it&#39;s mentioned as only one murdered,&quot; Arvind pointed out, his eyes still glued to the screen. &quot;Is the husband not dead?&quot;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5">&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; Manoj replied. &ldquo;His name is Aryan, and in fact, we had him arrested just a week after this murder case, right here in this very station.&rdquo; He gestured to the Electronic City police station, the building next to the lab.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c9">Arvind&#39;s head snapped up. His eyes, now burning with purpose, locked onto Manoj. &quot;Tell me everything you know about this guy. Everything!&quot; He turned to Gokul and Rajkumar, a new fire in his voice. &quot;I want you guys to find out where this guy is right now. Go!&quot;</span></p><div><p class="c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0"></span></p></div><div class="c24"><p class="c21"><a href="#cmnt_ref1" id="cmnt1">[a]</a><span class="c0">Love this image!</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c0">1 total reaction</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c0">Prijith Pillai reacted with &#128515; at 2025-08-16 02:07 AM</span></p></div><div class="c24"><p class="c21"><a href="#cmnt_ref2" id="cmnt2">[b]</a><span class="c0">&#128525;</span></p></div></body></html>
